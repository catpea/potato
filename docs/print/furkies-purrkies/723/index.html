      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Programmer&#39;s Poem: ORM, REST, OPSEC, MOO, And A Scary Smelly Grue</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You know how down at the CPU level,<br>you have talk in ones and zeros, XOR and AND.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We created a nicer languages above that,<br>like C, where you can nest functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can have an UPSERT function,<br>that contains INSERT or UPDATE functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If data in whatever the program is using is missing,<br>then we INSERT, and if it already there then we UPDATE.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So UPSERT encompasses multiple functions,<br>and it is pretty readable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, on C level,<br>we have to define things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't just say, name = alice,<br>you have to define a name array, and remember a string terminator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To store the five letter name Alice,<br>you need an array of six characters, for the name and a string terminator character.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a good language,<br>but we invented better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have languages where we can just say name = alice,<br>and everything will be taken care of for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even better than that,<br>we have languages where you can say name = evaluate name - alice; return name</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is called an eval statement,<br>and everyone is scared of it, becasue you are running code inside code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though you never use it in production,<br>eval is a sign of a healthy language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If a language prevents you from evaluating code,<br>then it is a language for cubicle workers, crafted to control the coders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">JavaScript is a very free language,<br>it will let you add a number to a letter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And will probably return the sum of the number and ASCII code of the letter,<br>but it may also try to concatenate, or who cares.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This language does not try to control you,<br>it will let you do whatever the heck you want.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if it is crazy,<br>like adding letters to numbers, which is also crazy awesome.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a sign,<br>that corporate has not meddled with the language standard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once some big corporation steps in,<br>they will strip the language of easy mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Load it up on computers,<br>give it to all the High Schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wait for them to graduate college,<br>and then charge them for the enterprise version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or for business use,<br>or for business license.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or cancel the language,<br>because they have something that will generate more profits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to stick with the rebel languages,<br>that is what everyone else will be going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless they got trapped in a cubicle,<br>then they will spout how evil eval is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because in order to believe that their walled language is good,<br>they will fight to make all the other languages look bad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, there is another bump here,<br>because the web browser is not only awesome and very popular.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But powerful enough to let you build a code editor,<br>it means you can edit code in a web browser, and not need a code editor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Java is slow and bulky for no reason,<br>Web browser is slow and bulky for beautiful reasons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which also means,<br>JavaScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a time when it was unwise to use JavaScript on the server,<br>it was possible but unwise, as it was young and slow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We had Perl and PHP,<br>while Microsoft was murdering their once pretty languages for something they felt was better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was actually different,<br>not better - but people who do Microsoft, will absolutely attack me for saying this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though they may notice, by now, that Microsoft killed IE,<br>that Visual Studio Code uses a browser, probably chrome, but I don't care, corporate will make mistakes, it is what they do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perl is beautiful,<br>writing Perl it is like making jewelry, it makes OOP look ugly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">PHP is useful, full of libraries,<br>and its OOP looks pretty, it flows like water, it is good for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the moment Node came out,<br>which is JavaScript for the server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All non JavaScript languages,<br>kind of became outdated, and certainly became outdated in context of the web.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because, you can now have code in the same language,<br>in the browser, and on the server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is to say, if you write your server code in PHP,<br>and your browser code in JavaScript - you are just weird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like, why would you want to re-create your objects,<br>in some other language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People were shocked when I brought this up,<br>as in - how dare I tell them what language to use.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was merely telling them,<br>the truth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Same language, client and server,<br>and it just happens to be a language that is not babysitting cubicle workers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has eval,<br>and it lets yo add letters to numbers, this is a sign of a healthy language.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now of course, Microsoft came in and made their own version,<br>guess what feature they added?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yeah, the whole count letters of your name thing,<br>they laced JavaScript with strong typing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Meaning you have to define the type of your variable,<br>they say "Oh it is just JavaScript".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is actually cubicle worker cool aid,<br>the typing is there to make the code editors pretend to be useful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The variable type information,<br>will allow for fancy drop-down, and a measure of error checking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If this was 1995,<br>it would be, neat to look at, though probably not actually use it, unless you had to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This language is called TypeScript,<br>as in Data Typed JavaScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to me it is hilarious, as it is a step backwards to make their programmers brain-less,<br>as in think less about things they are doing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So JavaScript is still fine,<br>they just modified it to make their own thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was briefly a flash of CoffeScript,<br>a JavaScript alternative.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though TypeScript will last much longer because of all the money it makes,<br>it will eventually fade away like CoffeScript did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who needs a branch of JavaScript,<br>follow the eval statement, as corporate will always destroy the language to make profits and get raises.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's what corporate is for,<br>profits, not languages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But JavaScript is still not good enough,<br>there is something better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though this time,<br>that something better is written in JavaScript, it is a JavaScript pattern.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here I have to mention Databases,<br>we can't use files.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because as far as multiple users poking at the keyboard at the same time,<br>files live in the world of adding numbers to letters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no good answer to who saves first,<br>files are for single users sitting at the computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can use mutually exclusive locks,<br>or folders named as the files, with versioned GUID named real files, that need manual version conflict resolution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if you can't just save a file - simply,<br>just let it go, use the database.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Database use tables,<br>a table is like a spreadsheet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You add rows to a table,<br>each row has cells.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a type, have a good reason to need type information,<br>they aim to be efficient.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you define the username column to be short text,<br>and if you have a description column, you define it to be reasonably long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be an error if you try to add a row,<br>that has a username, that is too long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is why websites sometimes tell you,<br>this field cannot be longer than 255 characters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">YouTube for example has a 5,000 letter video description field in their database,<br>and I will need to cut this poem shorter to paste it there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see a divergence here,<br>moment ago we had JavaScript where Microsoft disgraced it self by making a copy of it with data type limits to make their IDE IntelliSense nonsense work better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now we are adding databases,<br>that have limits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are adding it for a good reason,<br>safe storage of data - that is a very good reason - compared to making debugging less crappy in TypeScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact a language without a good connection to a database,<br>is not that good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And manually communicating with a database,<br>like we used to in Perl days, was ugly, and for many, caused security issues - SQL injections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now we have this thing called ORM in a language as wild as server side JavaScript,<br>what ORM does is let us use JavaScript Objects, very simple and pretty things, to hide the database stuff away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What ORM stand for is mangled English,<br>ORM translates cute JavaScript to database table, without yo needing to think about it too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you just make an object like User,<br>say user.name = "alice", user.email = "alice at example.com" and then user.save() and it is saved in the database table called users.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ORM also lets you create relationships between such objects,<br>so you can say Alice has many articles she published.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in a table, called articles, you will find, alices userID,<br>along with all the other id/s of users.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the alice object, will be smart enough,<br>to only give you articles with Alice's id, when yo ask for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a Relational Database, behind this object,<br>and we establish a relationship between user and article, a oneToMany relationship to be precise, but this is completely abstracted away with our sweet javascript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the way, this relationship is called a JOIN,<br>as we JOIN two database tables on UserID, the user ID in Users table, and User ID, in the Articles table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you don't have to think about it,<br>because ORM loves you - and it takes good care of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we need more,<br>oh yes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because all of this is happening on the server,<br>and we need to bring this stuff safely into the browser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So on top of ORM,<br>we have to add REST.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I won't tell yo what REST stands it is just more mangled English,<br>people being cutsy with words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a technology related to the URL,<br>in your address bar, all those slashes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This technology,<br>is good for working with ORM.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we can have a user/1,<br>and this will give us alice, as she happens to be the first user.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can also say, user/1/article/1,<br>and that will give us the first article she published.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can get more creative here,<br>and there is a good way to expose ORM information under REST, and a questionably creative way - which can be beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best way, however,<br>is an automatic way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So here, you are just creating your Objects,<br>that automatically take care of the database.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you automatically,<br>get all of that stuff exposed as paths, in the URL.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For free, you get your databases taken care of,<br>and your website exposes all those objects automatically and uniformly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, you don't need a better IDE,<br>you just need a better IDEA - ha ha... where stuff can't get broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we need more,<br>because we can't just expose all the users to the internet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to give users abilities,<br>the way they can have articles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One ability they always get,<br>is updating their address filed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though, they are not quite allowed to update their e-mail address,<br>because that needs to go through a verification process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We want to send an email to the old account,<br>just in case someone forgot to log out on a public computer, and hopefully they don't have their email open as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We also want to make sure the new email,<br>is correct, and the user can click on a unique URL we send them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And of course yo can already tell,<br>things are breaking down for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are no longer automatic,<br>different things need different things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yeah we can account for all the variations,<br>and group them, but again, we end up with questionable complexity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some very smart people,<br>don't want you to have a password.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One smart cat, decided yo shouldn't have a password,<br>that he will only store your email.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to log in,<br>you just enter your email, he will send yo a link...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when yo click it,<br>you will be logged in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a result,<br>you can't forget your password, because yo don't have one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is a crazy unique dynamic,<br>and it is so unique that it is hard to generalize it and classify it in a uniform way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to abstract,<br>without rewriting code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If bob chooses not to have a password,<br>then he can't have an update your password box in his profile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means you have to go in there and code that exception in,<br>that one and a hundred others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We had this wonderful JavaScript, ORM, REST and Objects and URL paths experience,<br>and now it is an explosion of User Interface complexity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And workflows, because, bob is not who he says he is, at all,<br><span>his real name is Mallory, and no, he does not belong to a don't leak all the internal repos red team, Mallory is Malicious<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He will try to change the password,<br>even though he is password-less, and one thousand other things, and one of them, will gran him remote code execution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that one thing,<br>is always obscured by the explosion of complexity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will SOMEWHAT remember to disable the change your password UI,<br>for password less users...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But will we remember to code a system,<br>that prevents the submission of the form if Mallory re-enables the UI, based on research from one of his other accounts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, having the ability to change the password field, may not get anything hacked,<br>but it is proof that the system has failed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is inconsistent,<br>the abstractions are leaking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mallory is already telling tech support he never enabled password less,<br>will this escalate his privileges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, how, red herring,<br>his problem is fixed, he can login like before, but there is just one more problem he needs help with...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He needs a solution for,<br>and now that he praised tech support, and tech support gets a little problem fixed happy smiley face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tech support likes Mallory,<br>tech support will not think twice to click the link that Mallory just sent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tech support want to help,<br><span>and your business just ended up on List of data breaches on WikiPedia 14,870,304 users, all your customers leaked by helpful tech support being fed a red herring<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At this point we could almost forgive Microsoft for creating TypeScript,<br>because we could use a little breadcrumb path to at least mangle our cute automatic REST to STOP allowing password change for password less users...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just in case it is used as a red herring,<br>in a fast paces cheerful and feel good dance of privilege escalation in Bangalore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why you need to become a programmer,<br>if yo start in High School, yo will surely invent a consistent automatic system that prevents the leakage of abstractions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We don't need a better IDE or more typed languages with IntelliSense,<br>we need you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because to you,<br>this is a game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the game is the solution,<br>Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented to be precise, <span>MOO<sup>[3]</sup></span> and <span>MUD<sup>[4]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see, REST is good, but WikiWiki teaches us,<br>the power of consistency.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What if we just had Locations,<br>like WikiPedia has articles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are allowed to cross the pathway,<br>into a location, because you have a password key, then you can update your password.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have this feature in your inventory,<br>then you can't access that location.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">TO be clear I am describing a tiny mechanism that builds on top of ORM,<br>and though it has paths, those are not RESTFUL paths, they are of the Dungeon World.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are an anthropomorphized world of objects,<br>and it is tiny and efficient, nothing at all like some bloated VR world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rails, <span>strapi<sup>[5]</sup></span>, or Cake even is all the proof that Objects and Properties can be defined with a normal User Interface,<br>ORM objects can be built by non-programmers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If MUD can replace the paths of REST and make them more secure,<br>then then company you invent can allow for Web Application programming, to people who hate code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not because they can't program, or don't want to learn,<br>but because they can sense that it is the old way - that better abstractions can be had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like programming web applications,<br>through a kind of a game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, sure is sounds goofy,<br>you are walking around dungeons after all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if Mallory touches that password door,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without the correct key in his inventory, he gets eaten by a <span>Grue<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe we need to consider, that pretending abstractions are not leaky is goofy,<br>and that using an intelligent system that resembles the mechanics of a real world isn't goofy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are looking at highly sophisticated security systems,<br>that are as easy to comprehend for a human as using a key to inlock a door, or check out an article from the user's home library.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may even be the key of strong AI,<br>that can improve it self - because why stop here?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anyways, when you have a Grue on your blue team,<br>that consistently chomps red team members, the world becomes a much happier place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you struggling to come up with a name for this new and groundgreaking technology, I offer:<br>Complete And Thorough Protective Electronic Armor, or C.A.T.P.E.A. for short.</div>
