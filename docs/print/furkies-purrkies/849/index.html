    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I started by learning <span>Hard Surface Modeling in Blender<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and creating a whole box of wallets and dodads that I printed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I jumped to <span>Krita<sup>[2]</sup></span> to brush up on my Drawing Skills, <span>creating many portraits<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>I really enjoyed using the Reference Images feature and its impact on color picker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I returned to Blender to learn to sculpt,<br>I really appreciate the huge range of sculpting tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then time came for <span>Geometry Nodes<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and I created a Procedural box with self generating hinges and a couple of rings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With all these powers combined,<br>I felt ready to create my first Captain Planet Ring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I was working in Krita I came across a <span>Baroque Kitbash<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>and this afternoon I spent $5 dollars on 150 very neat Baroque Decorations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They all appear to be hand made,<br>and I hope the Author is feeling well, I left the highest ratings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I performed my first Import of 3rd Party Artwork today,<br>and it being hand made, required very little tweaking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">“Set Origin &gt; Geometry To Origin” and reset position, rotation, and tweak scale,<br>I imported the *.fbx files, there were no *.blend files, or blender native files.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am still <span>learning Blender<sup>[6]</sup></span> so I immediately jumped to using the <span>Lattice Modifier<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>with a lattice of resolution set to 4; you will find setting in the right hand pane.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I tested to see if the mirror modifier can work,<br>to mirror the decoration across the ring, it did, it was crazy, and I made several cat noises.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in the end, I added too much and the Boolean Operations do not work correctly,<br>meaning I can’t fuse the rings geometry into a singe object.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is OK, because I really like the design, so I’ll bring it back,<br>in the next version of the ring - those wings on the front look so neat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way to achieve stable geometry,<br>is as always, to keep things simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the shapes that are imported,<br>must lay down flat at zero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you may use a lattice modifier,<br>to distort the flat arrangement around a ring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you may make a linked copy,<br>and reuse the arrangement on multiple sized rings or bracelets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I additionally recommend the use of the mirror modifier,<br>so that you will only ever need to work on one side of the ring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is something I only did for the little flowers,<br>I copied the three items on the side of the ring by hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But don’t do that, as decorations always need adjustments,<br>and now they require the same adjustment on the other side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though you are just adding a minus sign,<br>it is annoying and error prone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the end you should only have one Boolean Operation,<br>and one source of potential problems to fix, if the union operation fails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just return to your original motif arrangement,<br>and make your repairs there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I must say that this ring does not have enough complexity,<br>for a 3D modeled ring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It needs flowers everywhere, and around,<br>it needs soooo many little crazy flowers...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That if a jeweler had to recreate this by hand it would take many months,<br>and a lot of patience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are just Starting Out with creating Jewelry in blender,<br>simply loosely re-create the Captain Planet Cartoon and Dark Souls Game Rings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It should be a lot of fun,<br>and lots of practice.</div>
