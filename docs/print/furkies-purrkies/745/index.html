      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Outrageous Little Idea Of The Tiny School Of Meow</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I feel I need to learn more about music,<br>but I also sense that what I am missing are techniques.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are paths of things in a sequence,<br>and they will produce interesting results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These paths are similar to Hyperrealistic portrait stylizations,<br>they are recipes that work best when done in a sequence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would say make hair shine before working on the eyes,<br>and leave cheekbone highlights for last as they will make the portrait jump out at you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In music, bass will come first,<br>but to make it dance-able the song must have very distinct parts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example a clean drum part,<br>where the dancer can focus on footwork in the same rhythm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To have more information than this,<br>I need a proper dance floor, and I may never have time for that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My aim is to help students out of poverty,<br>and the first thing is probably Digital Paining.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Workout Music Composition, requires practicing dancing,<br>and getting into the world of beat sequencers and song structure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art requires just one thing,<br>dancing about three three things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I leave out portrait photography,<br>as that is such a tiny and fun lecture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With what I have learned of art right now,<br>it is better not to use a website or portrait challenges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That will result in painting a painting that somebody else is painting too,<br>and can cause a plagiarism accusation, unfortunately.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will have to ask students to use selfless or family portraits,<br>but that is still slightly easier than music composition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I keep looking at my table of 3D printed parts,<br>and I really want to work on the Superhero Belt to make a class out of that too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art took me by surprise,<br>the entire wall into the world of art didn't just crumble but was illusory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It emerges out of teachers asking us not to trace,<br>and tricking us into beveling that drawing slightly crooked things by hand is superior art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is a lie, using shape and color reference,<br>is a superior teacher, and will make a master in less than ten easy to handle paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again, this is easier than 3D Modeling, and 3D Printing lectures,<br>so Digital Painting lectures must come first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Youngest students,<br>who aren't bothered by the nonsense of needing to draw freehand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will have the most amazing time,<br>they will not need ten paintings to invent their ow style.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In some cases, just looking at the videos,<br>will have people reinventing the base idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think distorting portraits in GIMP,<br>and then photobashing in Krita is going to become a popular variation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I feel like the initial art class,<br>will bear the name of "Classical Digital Painting"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though this school is best created by using MediaWiki,<br>the program behind Wikipedia and then linking to videos and axternal content.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I begun work on the computer program that will host an exerimental version of the school school,<br>though the idea is no different than Wikipedia, or Wikiversity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The content, is about easy to access on-ramps,<br>and complete disregard for a standardized curriculum that cheap schools use.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the students learn at their own pace,<br>and each wikipage enhances their abilities in ways that they did not anticipate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The content requires many volunteer editors,<br>or several years of me poking at it in my free time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I can already map out lectures on Poetry, Digital Paining, 3D Modeling For Printing,<br>Electronic Dance Music, Computer Aided Exercise, Shuffle Dancing, Camping and Bicycling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And somewhat surprisingly Programming,<br>as of last week I think I finally have an easy on ramp here too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The mistake I was making earlier is to start with code,<br>I need to start with boilerplate server applications wrapped in a visual programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That then allow the programming of custom nodes,<br>that can be used in the visual programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These programs are somewhat similar to NodeRED,<br>though aim to control a small website, as in hold a focus on practical applications including ecommerce via stripe and the like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the students will be given a cookbook of nodes,<br>where they could splice their own recipes, and make their code public.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a copy and paste introduction,<br>to expanding programs that are already working.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In my mind all of this far too overwhelming,<br>both in details and scale to ever get it done...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this does not stop me form visualizing a MediaWiki,<br>where all these rapid result lectures can be put together anyway.</div>
