    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to care about our elder-selves and our mental well-being across decades,<br>is to start early, slowly, and carefully, and fuel our self education by means of our curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are each a very unique person,<br>and our journey into self education will be perfectly unique, and will move at different speeds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am very worried about people who focus on College and Career as their only path forward,<br>while this path may lead to some measure of success, it is unlikely to consider our well being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not workers or cogs in profit maximization, we are inventors, thinkers, and dreamers,<br>we have delicate minds, and we have delicate bodies that as we age are more likely to require more and more care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that,<br>we are also learners - our genius, imagination, and mind has no limits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And our ultimate aim is to grow,<br>to grow all the way up, until we become wise and great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is extremely important for our growth,<br>for our flourishing as a Human Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This must be considered by every job opportunity and career,<br>and even by the schools we go to, even by the cities that our schools are in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We become very ill, both in mind and body,<br>when our job across decades fails to help us grow.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am certain there are but few people that are interested in this particular alternative that I am about to describe,<br>but it is my hope that we can each imagine a similar path, by subtle analogy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As that saying goes,<br>a picture is worth a million words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I would like to present you with,<br>something I am looking through right now, on my own journeys.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am currently looking over a free Open Source program called FreeCAD,<br>CAD, stands for Computer Aided Design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I have come across a set of videos entitled,<br><span>Design a Raspberry Pi case for 3d printing by using FreeCAD<sup>[1]</sup></span> it comes in four short parts (<span>part 1<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>part 2<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>part 3<sup>[4]</sup></span>, <span>part 4<sup>[5]</sup></span>).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And fresh on my mind is a photo of employees and a small reindeer woman of <span>https://www.trayvax.com/<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>a small manufacturer of machined wallets, that led me to consider making my own wallet, with the use of 3D printing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In my mind learning from tutorials,<br>or a self education that helps us manufacture unique products...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creates a safety net to any larger Carrier undertaking that we maybe otherwise considering,<br>it shows the way of an inventor, of an independent business person, of a self educated person.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>And while this particular picture works best to inspire a High School student<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>there are many more like it, of every shape and every size, for anybody at any age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most are <strong>small</strong> business ideas, that do require a budget for constant advertising in order to be seen,<br>but rather than failure, they lead to a small trickle of money, which then allows for creating few more such little marvels, some of which can be sold altogether to other inventors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Growing up as a small business owner<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>is a wonderful way to slowly learn at just the perfect pace, and arrange for an independent career.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if only to have that possibility open,<br>which greatly relives stress, and answers many "what if" questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I firmly believe that each and every one of us infinitely brilliant,<br>and whatever natural-born genius is, it pales in comparison to a path inspired by our own curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A path that is sure to help us in the quest towards Wisdom and Greatness<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>a quest that each end every one of us deserves, a quest that will keep us strong and healthy both in mind and body.</div>
