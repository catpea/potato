    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I hope that as I get better at art,<br>all parts of my paintings will have their own little masks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A visor on a knight’s helmet, a hand, both shoes,<br>are all a good mask candidates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A knights helmet benefits from several masks,<br>one for the visor, others for any decorations and/or layers of armor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest reason for masking,<br>is the ability to spray color on a helmet visor for example...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without any of that paint,<br>getting on the helmet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I mention knights armor,<br>because it is textured shiny metal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is best to build up the colors here,<br>with long sprays that go up and down the armor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wouldn't just be hard to color armor with a digital spray brush,<br>it maybe impossible to do it without masks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">There does exist a simple mechanism for not going over the line,<br>it is referred to as making a selection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it draws an ant line around pixels in the image,<br>whatever is within that ant line, will be impacted by a spray brush for example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A digital painting requires selecting multiple things many times over,<br>it would be very boring to continue carefully selecting everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the process of saving a selection could be useful,<br>but there is a problem with selection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is such a big problem,<br>that programmers kind of don’t bother adding that feature in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An ant line selection is a yes or no mechanism,<br>with the potential of feathering the edges, though equally all around.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make the long story short, due to the yes or no nature of selection,<br>you can’t feather a shadow along with the sharp outline of some artifact.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when you use masks, which by default use white for select and black for deselect,<br>you are allowed to use all the shades of gray between black and white, to mark selection strength.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another way to think about selection strength,<br>is transparency of the area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is reasonable to gently keep a shadow selected for operations,<br>but here you think of it in terms of transparency.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After all that is what feathering means,<br>don't completely affect the are, but do so just ever so barely, almost invisibly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Masking is a large feature,<br>to make it go, programmers build it into the concept of layers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the full name for the masking feature,<br>is “LAYER MASKS”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may ask “Does Krita support layer masks?”,<br>“Yes, yes it does - it works just like in GIMP.”</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This also means that you have to divide your image into layers,<br>while being mindful of masks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When a person is starting out Digital Painting,<br>it may make sense to put an entire Knight’s helmet on a single layer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the very top of the Knight,<br>keeping it on a separate layer is perfectly reasonable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But with masking,<br>you want to break the helmet up into all its components.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You want a separate layer mask for the helmet visor,<br>because you will need to spray the metal gradient at a slight offset.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, the feather on a knights head, is a good example of... feathering,<br>the feather will not use a white color, it will be bright gray to make the feather slightly transparent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the gray will get darker towards the edges,<br>to softly fade the feather out, for the ultimate touch of headdress realism.</div>
