  <div class="paragraph">Art is something we all adore,<br>but it has always been at war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The greatest creators,<br>and machine inventors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Versus the Free Hand,<br>who call machines contraband.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Renascence was born of machines,<br>born to impress Royal Queens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, no one ever says anything,<br>and a lot of artists are lying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot are suffering,<br>as if their hands are tied with string.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They don't know how the others draw so well,<br>and most of them will never tell.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But art is the noblest science,<br>born of beauty and defiance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the beginning she gifts us the best:<br>realism at its finest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She does not want us to worry about crooked lines,<br>she wants us to break <strong>out of</strong> their confines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in deed,<br>we are all granted <strong>all</strong> the tools we need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From proportional dividers, to all kinds of tracing,<br>she wants to set our hearts racing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art wants to set us free,<br>not get an art degree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Important part of your art,<br>are the machines at its heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The critics and teachers,<br>can't understand all the features.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School was always wrong about thinking free,<br>it was always about you paying some fee.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art must never deny entry,<br>we should all practice realism in elementary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We should all be invited to art,<br>because it is just another expression of our heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK to make the lines perfect,<br>and all the colors perfectly correct.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is evil to say,<br>that you can't copy, or have it your way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only when realism becomes something that we have outgrown,<br>can we truly say that our style ... is our own.</div>
