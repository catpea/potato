      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">On Education And World Peace</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are three types of schooling,<br>Organized Education, Home Schooling, and Self Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is the only one that is not broken,<br>as the student learns in the sequence that matches their existing knowledge an at a pace they are comfortable with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Home schooling is broken because it isolates the student from constantly evolving culture,<br>and because it aims to pass standardized tests, which do not work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And organized education is broken because of money, grades, curricula, drugs, bullying/violence,<br>lack of funding, and focus on statistics rather than individual student success in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education, is extremely pleasant, but very difficult go get right, and pretty expensive,<br>but it does not really compare to the insane problems of standardized testing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self education must begin with travel,<br>and must keep at it, geographic movement is extremely important for the mind and grasp on cultures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a student curious about architecture or archaeology,<br>that means vising dozens of <span>cathedrals<sup>[1]</sup></span> across the entire world, and that's just to start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">However, a student who has no interest in things related to cathedrals,<br>must never be forced or encouraged to go anywhere near them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the problem with standardized lectures,<br>a student must not be forced into things that are irrelevant to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Doing so will cause low grades, low self esteem,<br>and probably push them away from all the people making them learn irrelevant crap.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A student who is interested in nature, climate, earth, or even survival situations,<br>must section hike the Appalachian Trail, The Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This would be extremely harmful to someone who does not like trials,<br>but for a nature lover, this will make them speeches and make them cry in their golden age and beyond.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may take them few years or a life time to finish hiking those trails,<br>but there is a chance they will start on their first philosophical treatise while still a teenager.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Home schooling should not involve standardized testing,<br>because standardized testing is not a path towards real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memorization, is not education,<br>comprehension of the mechanics behind a formula is education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The standardized curriculum,<br>prevents real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Home schooling, is different from self education,<br>because it involves the entire family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is like self education I described,<br>but never alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The family members become supportive tutors,<br>to the interests of the young student.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here parents should not make the mistake that a student wants to become a musician because they are curious about music,<br>not should they get angry when the student drops everything to record their first album.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are not the final aims, they are just small milestones along the way,<br>selling their first album, is a venture into business, and potentially running their own record label.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A broad curiosity about music, is a call to visit a number of schools that teach music for money,<br>and a lot of it is about a yearning to meet creative minds across different cultures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Student must always choose the path,<br>even if they hate math, they will eventually drop right in the center of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it programming music, making a computer game, an app that deals with GPS and path finding,<br>they will be inspired and ravenous for math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will need tutors that are familiar with presenting frameworks to the self educated,<br>that means their lectures will need to be structured like a memory palace, for example learning math by studying its development across history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now onto organized education,<br>it is completely broken, and rotten at the core due to the stupid idea of standardized education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized education is just another name for a standardized way to process students into little paychecks,<br>and that is fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But get this, that organized education even exists, is a beautiful miracle,<br>one the curriculum gets repaired our schools will become the most important invention across all time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It has been possible to fix schools for a couple of decades now,<br>yes because computers, can provide a costumed educational experience that is relevant to the student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That teachers still teach standardized lesson plans today,<br><span>is a piece of evidence that schools are not about children but about milking them for paychecks<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools in the state that they are now are artificially halting progress,<br>to squeeze every dollar they can, for as long as they can.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it really was about the students teachers would stage a walkout,<br>until the curriculum became personalized to the unique needs of each student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first step to repair organized education,<br>is to remove the standardized curriculum and install a computer driven, student controlled curriculum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students need to get paid for study,<br>at first a dignified hourly reward of atelast twice the minimum wage, and later a life long universal income program - a card with a hundred dollar spending limit (automatically adjusted for inflation).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Students require housing, as student exchange programs are very important to real education,<br>travel will aid in expansion of mind, becoming unstuck from indoctrination, propaganda, bad culture, and bad family, bad teachers, and it will help the world find peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The idea of organized education is a magnificent masterpiece,<br>but the standardized curriculum holds it hostage and <strong>prevents</strong> real education, and pushes back advancement of the Human Kind, keeping us trapped in poverty and darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No generation should be the same as precious, the blight of corruption, indoctrination, mass incarceration, and mutually assured destruction,<br>must give way to better ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must advance, we are just a chain link, temporary keepers,<br>the world belongs to the younger, and all the future generations to come.</div>
