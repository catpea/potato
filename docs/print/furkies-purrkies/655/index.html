      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Self Education First</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to learn within a preset time period,<br>nor is it possible to learn following some curriculum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even in self education we can't expect to just finish a subject on time,<br>we may need to stop for several weeks, for any number of reasons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though the way we dictate our own path in self education,<br>is perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools need to use computers to allow students to build their own path,<br>and as an extension of this self directed learning, the students will learn at the correct pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is just the top of the iceberg,<br>the consequences of preset time divisions and prearranged curricula are devastating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By forcing students to learn at a specific pace, and in a specific sequence,<br>we turn them away from education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it gets even worse, because we then grade them down,<br>and convince them that they are not smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not as smart as the kids that are just memorizing,<br>with minimal comprehension.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To add insult to injury,<br>the teachers may not be aware they are preventing real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when cornered about it, they may just say,<br>"How were we supposed to know."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important to admit that schools are not working,<br>and that grades are neither correct not a judgment of intelligence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just look at the teachers, surely they were A grade students,<br>they have little idea that they are not only failing, but preventing real education as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In their misunderstanding,<br>they are convincing children that they can't learn as well as the smart kids.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of students will not pick up a book after that,<br>they will not try to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will never figure out that schools were broken,<br>that they were sold out for paychecks...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But convinced they are not smart,<br>for no reason at all.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There may not be any change on the way,<br>schools may permanently stay the way they are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>We used to talk about saving the Amazon, but there was no change, just talk<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>we lost 20 percent of the Amazon in 45 years<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Young people have to understand,<br>that reason is not the driving force - and we need reason to survive into the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are a beautiful idea, in terms of reason,<br>but fake schools are a beautiful idea in terms of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Same as with the Rain Forest of Brazil, saving it is beautiful in terms or reason,<br>destroying it for short term money, is more fetching to people wanting to escape poverty.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Education is very special, because proper education,<br>will protect the world and help our civilization grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education people can't see the wrongs,<br>with real education we can correct our mistakes before it is too late.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With real education the world would probably create a Universal Income programme,<br>that would prevent farmers from clearing the land.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is a Kurt Vonnegut quote that I want to mention in closing,<br>"True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to understand this,<br>correctly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First of all, forget today's politicians, they will soon retire,<br>the students of today; are future politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they need real education to repair the world,<br>broken by the uneducated, who live in a fantasy world, and don't what happens to the world after they pass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that laws must be created with future generations in mind,<br>and this requires reality based lifestyles, real thinking, real education, real wisdom, and real greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that children of today need a real education,<br>as they will be inheriting a broken world that will require greatness of mind to fix.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means that we can't pretend to get an education,<br>we need real education instead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need self education,<br>because fake diploma-based education cannot be tolerated, as it means nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of real teachers,<br>we must become the teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Powerful, reality based, self education must come first,<br>real knowledge will beget wisdom, and wisdom will beget greatness.</div>
