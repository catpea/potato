    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have first learned of Trail Magic from Bill Bryson,<br>in his book entitled <span>A Walk In The Woods<sup>[1]</sup></span>, which later became a <span>Movie<sup>[2]</sup></span> with <span>Robert Redford and Nick Nolte<sup>[3]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used to adventure over at <span>Nordhouse Dunes<sup>[4]</sup></span> in Michigan,<br>It is a Wilderness, and it is unwise to think of it as small.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It costs $15 per week, for the car permit,<br>there are water pumps here and there, though once I saw a couple filtering Lake Michigan water.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The camp sites are by an ancient dune,<br>where you get to fall asleep, to the endless horizon of the great Lake Michigan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, you are facing west,<br>which means every evening closes with a Beautiful Sunset.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are some more pricey less rustic camp sites in the area,<br>and I remember reading a warning about Bears!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is real Wilderness, but the Bears are gentle,<br>and any rustling you will hear in the middle of the night will be the wind, and nothing more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most dangerous things out there will be your knife,<br>and the occasional thunderstorm which you can often watch headed your way over the Lake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The place comes to life after a Rainfall,<br>and the woods smell so nice, a mix of Pine Cones and Perfect Nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no raccoons, and mosquitoes won't bother you,<br>if you bring a repellent.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One time, on my way back to my camp site,<br>probably from an expedition to get an ice cream bar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ran into three young hikers a Lady and Two of Her Brothers that were gathering up wood,<br>and <span>setting up camp two thirds of the way to the lake<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I asked what happened, and they said the lake was just too far for them,<br>and they decided to camp here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I told them that the beach was just around the corner, which was about 2,000 ft,<br>and passionately offered to help them carry their stuff.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They didn't set up their tens yet, so they quickly rolled up whatever they had out<br>I grabbed all the heavy stuff and we started walking to the beach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I immediately begun explaining that I've learned of Trail Magic from Bill Bryson,<br>and I defined it as, someone helping, without wanting anything in return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went on talking about Nordhouse, and what it is like out there,<br>I talked about the dunes, and greatly emphasized that there is a Beach out there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I mentioned that we were on the <span>Nurnberg End Of Trail<sup>[6]</sup></span> which is the harder way,<br>with <span>West Forest Trail End<sup>[7]</sup></span> being somewhat easier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We arrived in no time, and I encouraged them to camp the night in the sandy dunes,<br>as it was absolutely the most beautiful spot there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They actually found an even more beautiful place,<br>by climbing up a near by dune, I am certain they had a great time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just as soon as they had their spot,<br>I waived goodbye, and <em>very</em> quickly hurried away to my own world and distant camp site.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did not want to give an impression that I expected a Thank You, or any such thing,<br>Trail Magic is just magic, no explanation, no thank you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow I just know,<br>they didn't have a hard time getting back to their car.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They originally gave up on making to the beach because it was late evening,<br>and they didn't know if they could make it before dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Helping is just what we do, and it is not a big deal,<br>but I am very proud that I told them about Bill Bryson, <span>Narrated Adventure Books<sup>[8]</sup></span>, and Trail Magic.</div>
