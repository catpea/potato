  <div class="paragraph">I know you are going to laugh,<br>but let me say it anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The locomotive horn,<br>has been bulling me since third grade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were trains by my <span>Grandma's in Wroclaw<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>so I heard the horn way before.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, it wasn't until <span>I moved closer to the trains<sup>[2]</sup></span> in third grade,<br>that I found I had quite enough - thank you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was out on a run,<br>just doing an extra tail end before finishing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Couple of minutes after I crossed the tracks,<br>I heard the train horn behind me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, I didn't think much of it,<br>I just kept running.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt a little warm glow about me,<br>my biceps were giving away heat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was carrying 10lb. in each arm,<br>I didn't ache, I wasn't tired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If that changes in the Summer,<br>if it is the cold that makes me so strong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, I am going to write a poem then,<br>like no tomorrow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As I was nearing the highway,<br>the city lamps ended.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it got pleasantly dark,<br>I put my headlamp on and lit the path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was just three miles in,<br>though it took forever, and half - two hours to be precise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I <strong>will</strong> improve my pace,<br>I am just having too much fun right now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made it to the western end of my trail,<br>and gracefully did a little loop-de-loop to run back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I find it is when you do a 180,<br>you often discover that you have been running with the wind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now you flip the pancake,<br>the side that was used to being hidden from the wind will now face it - Ouch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In less than five minutes,<br>I pulled up my mask and my cheeks squeaked from the cold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>Hey</strong>, I am not a mountain goat,<br>yet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had my track jacket and a wind breaker,<br>in my bag, so it was not a problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After few more minutes,<br>I got used to the new chill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that's when I saw it,<br>the light were still blinking by the train tracks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was like twenty minutes since I heard the horn,<br>so the train stopped.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I saw a couple of cars shoot out of the Movie Theater road,<br>pause, and drive away after a moment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was cut off from getting home,<br>and I couldn't stop and wait, because I would get cold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made it to the train cars,<br>took my backpack off and put my headphones in there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't want to loose them while crossing,<br>but my lightweight bag was no good for 20lb. of iron.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I had to hurl them across the tracks,<br>between the train cars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Thump,<br>the first one landed OK, but a bit short.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to push the second harder,<br>but it went to the side and landed in the rocks getting scuffed up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was weakened from carrying the 20lb.,<br>for two hours straight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that became really apparent,<br>as I heaved myself up the ladder on the side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I carefully moved between the train cars,<br>and then grabbed a bar that moved while making a squeaking noise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would have grabbed something else if the bar was lose,<br>but I could have done away with that metal squeak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt pain in my arms,<br>I am usually a lot stronger</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The train popped up in the middle of my workout,<br>after all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then as I made it to the corner I forgot the ladder was on the side,<br>and had a whoopse moment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made the corner, and down like a pro,<br>with the words "Westland Loco" on my mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is crazy that there is no other way to cross the road,<br>the Ford. Rd. overpass above is even more dangerous then crossing the train.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Locomotives,<br>are loco.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I got my headphones back on, took a photo,<br>and kept shuffling on - my apartment being only like 15 minutes away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've decided not to cross the tracks again,<br>I really like that spot where the city lamps end...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, I don't want to get cut-off again,<br>even though there is a ladder, it is dangerous and pretty loco to climb trains.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I woke up in the morning,<br>there was snow on the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's probably what that chill was,<br>the temperature was dropping in preparation for a bit of snow.</div>
