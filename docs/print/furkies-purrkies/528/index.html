      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Computer Aided Design or CAD Is Somewhat Easy</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy, but you have to take it easy,<br>you have to be good to yourself and learn for a long time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For me, I think it was an old DOS computer,<br>that had a CAD program installed on on it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while I had no idea what CAD was,<br>as I was still busy with learning English.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I understood what was going on,<br>but for one reason only - because of how elegant it was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The screen was divided in four parts,<br>top view, left view, front view and a 3D view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I could see that editing a thing from front, left, right and top,<br>would allow me to create any shape I wanted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This made a great impression on me,<br>as <span>I could create things in three dimensions without rotoscoping<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For the sake of completion, the program I was looking at was probably a cheap clone of<br><span>DOS 3D Studio<sup>[2]</sup></span> or <span>some ancient version of AutoCAD<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Next time 3D graphics came up,<br>was <span>when I discovered POV-Ray<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a great power in trading the user interface,<br>for a programming language, instead of clicking you are coding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn’t know it at the time,<br>but POV-Ray was my introduction to <span>Generative Art<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Over time,<br>I daydream about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A handful of daydreams,<br>across many years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few years ago <span>I played around with Zbrush<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>to see if maybe I could learn something more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally, couple of years ago,<br><span>I got tired of heavy wallets during my workouts and sat down to TinkerCAD, to make a new one<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My wallet came out as block of plastic, and it wasn’t very nice,<br>but TinkerCAD helped me learn about <span>use of Substraction in 3D modeling<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Which led me to few other 3D concepts<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>and I felt that I was really making progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yesterday morning I got FreeCAD running on my Walmart laptop,<br>and this morning, I studied “<span>FreeCAD Boolean Operations in Part Design<sup>[10]</sup></span>” video.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And figured it all out, including a crazy little thing where if you try to do a drag select from upper left to lower right you select points<br>if you drag lower right to upper left you select lines, and what a fantastic idea.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>I only made the front of the new wallet<sup>[11]</sup></span>,<br>as the back is much easier, and I have to put it all together to see if it is maybe a bit too small.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take a few days to make the design more intricate - the artistic components will be incredible.<br><span>but it is now available on TinkerCAD for inspection<sup>[12]</sup></span>, the wallet front and back plates are bound together by paracord.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is my first real CAD project from scratch,<br>the only one I made previously is a case for my audio player, but that was me modifying existing designs in TinkerCad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wallet is practice for making the case from scratch,<br>which as you can see in the “<span>FreeCAD Boolean Operations in Part Design<sup>[13]</sup></span>” is not that hard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I must mention that the prototype design was inspired by the early <span>Trayvax Wallets<sup>[14]</sup></span>,<br>but the direction I am going towards, is an artistic wallet that can store a car key fob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also won't be using standard para-cord,<br>but elastic-shoelace type material which will also form the locking mechanism,<br>there will be a loop of elastic to lach on the inner tab that in the cutout area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We should never forget how fun learning for real,<br>really is.</div>
