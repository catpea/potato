  <div class="paragraph">You know that scary horror movie you saw as a child?<br>it's coming back the moment you set your foot in the wild.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know "Ha ha" - you say,<br>but just wait until the end of day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alf, Oompa-Loompas, Aliens, Gremlins, The Freaking Omen,<br>that giant from the Goonies, along with the gigantic woman...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...even the Jaws' shark,<br>will show up the moment it gets dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If it's quiet,<br>it will sound like a riot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you can hear them tiptoeing your way,<br>and there is nothing you can do or say.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The only way to get through the night,<br>is just going to sleep clutching your flashlight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you better <strong>hhhhhope</strong> that your bathroom tent is not too far away,<br>unless you want to meet Chucky, from Child's Play.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Just the moment you calm you heartbeat,<br>you remember snakes are drawn to heat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me tell you, if you see a puff adder in Michigan,<br>you'll be lyke "I am never camping again.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But don't worry, they are only mildly toxic when they bite,<br>that's assuming that Wikipedia is right.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And if not the snakes; then the spiders come out at night,<br>because they are attracted to your light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are the color of sand,<br>so you won't see them on land.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless you have a good flashlight and shine on their shiny butts,<br>sometimes you find so many, it's nuts.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But the most frightening thing are the woodland creatures,<br>as each has very deadly features.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bald eagle has very sharp claws,<br>and will try to gently touch your head, just because.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bats don't actually get stuck in you hair,<br>they just land there, to lick them like crazy, I swear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Deer have antlers that are actually super sticky,<br>if you stick to one, things get tricky.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I once heard a story about a hawk,<br>that crashed into a car like a rock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To this day, I kick myself that I didn't say,<br>"HOW HAWKWARD" as that would have been a much better day.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">By far the worst animals are the Bobcat and <span>The Owl<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>one will Hoot Hoot and the other GrowleEEEEEEEEEEeE</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Bobcat,<br>will try to bite you in the butt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In their culture that is a show of affection,<br>and it's hard to deny that they make a connection.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The owl, looking down from up in the air,<br>gets seriously confused about balding mens' hair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless the man has a hat,<br>the owls will think that it is a plump rat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And with great fanfare,<br>they will swoop down, and rip and tear.</div>
