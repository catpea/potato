  <div class="paragraph">Many will say that it is not possible to become an artist,<br>without the mastery of color - this is not true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The early painters experienced this,<br>sometimes they'd start with a black and white painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And then glaze<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>with a see trough transparent color over the parts that needed it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So in that way, the Art Masters,<br>would finish the painting before adding color.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are two things to consider,<br>mixing color, and creating a color theme.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>It is one thing to try to match a rose pedal<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br><span>with a tiny little bit of practice that becomes really easy<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just be mindful that the secondary color you create,<br>is always a mix of the two primaries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Free your mind by arranging a color wheel on your palette,<br>yes you know how to make a green, but keep it organized.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To de-saturate a color,<br>mix it with the opposite on the color wheel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are attacking the color with the colors across,<br>and it will fade, color sin nature are never fully saturated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the color is attacked then the primaries are at it,<br>you will have a dark mix, so always have your white ready to increase the brightness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">But sometimes what you think you want,<br>only seems like a good idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, in the complexity of your painting,<br>you will lose the harmony, the song, the opera, the clarity of expression.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An you will end up with multiple color themes in one painting,<br>all wondering what is going on, and feeling lost.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Look behind Mona Lisa, that is a color theme<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>it belongs in the background, and it stays there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mona Lisa has two layers,<br>the background and the portrait.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each layer has a separate color theme,<br>and the two themes are not angry with each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you look at the <span>Mona Lisa from Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>oh boy, the outrageous red of her selves and the wrong blue of the sky are flirting, scandalous!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let me just say,<br>it was <span>NÖÖÖT! a good idea to restore the background and to a color that is so obviously wrong<sup>[6]</sup></span> - I am sorry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They ruined a Mona Lisa, probably a Leonardo,<br>possibly recovering an underlying experiment with longevity of glazes... and called it restoration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a harmonious color theme,<br>it is all wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(If anybody who ruined that painting is listening to this poem,<br>please stop now, you do not want to hear what I am about to say.)</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You see, the color a painting, is the second work of art,<br>the color <span>palette<sup>[7]</sup></span>, <span>scheme<sup>[8]</sup></span>, <span>theme<sup>[9]</sup></span> or <span>swatch<sup>[10]</sup></span>, whatever you wish to call it.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>I recently saw an artist create a beautiful thing<sup>[11]</sup></span>,<br>and I noticed what he was doing for color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Neon Pastel Theme,<br>he wouldn't date to even think about picking a color from another palette.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we should learn from him,<br>there are plenty of celebrated color palettes out there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you create your art in a specific palette,<br>or re-color your source image with he colors from the palette you like, you are all set.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if eyes need a glow, magical richness,<br>it is OK to add a custom color, though it will stick out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This of course bring us back mixing colors,<br>because whatever palette you picked...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And looooong before you even look at you canvas,<br>you have to spend a day or two mixing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me underline the gravity of this step for you,<br>because I did not have anyone underline colors for me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you pick your palette,<br>and recolor your source image, perhaps on a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You then need to make a trip to your dollar store,<br>and look for cute little glass jars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, mirroring a palette by mixing your own colors,<br>create a little treasure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ten or so little jars,<br>full of the colors you picked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A color palette that you like,<br>is your friend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is completely understandable if not downright lovely,<br>if you pick subjects because they match your favorite palette.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But of course you can have many such color collections,<br>a palette for portraits, a palette for snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you are done mixing you then place your little jars,<br>into a <span>1980's vintage cupboard you found while thrifting<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If anybody asks,<br>you cross your arms in deep thought and say "Those are my colors."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see,<br>colors live a life that is separate from your paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Colors,<br>are an art in it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a little know fact that color palettes call to their artists,<br>to make them create even more art.</div>
