      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Humanity Must Advance</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity's advancement forward,<br>must be our primary concern.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By standing still,<br>we make room for liars and parasites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sustained momentum with which we move forward,<br>should be one of our greatest treasures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The pressure to stop advancing,<br>can only come from those who benefit from illness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These boogie man tales of economic collapse,<br>arising from people no longer struggling in poverty - are lies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the same pattern of behavior,<br>that kept slaves from rising.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Doomsday Tales, Overwork, Uneducation,<br>are the tools of a slave owner.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Building walls while telling each other that people over the next border,<br>are bad, or different, or not us, or criminal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is very similar to to slave owners were not telling their slaves,<br>about great cities, about happy and friendly people - the uprisings were prevented from occurring, because nobody knew anything to rise to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one should be allowed<br>to benefit from poverty, war, misery, crime, uneducated consumers, uninformed patients, and cheap employees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Someone dialed the wrong number this morning,<br>and this is a voice message I got at 3 AM, <em>PLAYS</em> a little later, I got another one <em>PLAYS</em></div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These recordings show how crime creates money, $20 at a time,<br>it is a massive industry, that with the way things are - will never be stopped.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ashley Williams, who you may remember from the "<span>I am NOT a Superpredator<sup>[1]</sup></span>" event,<br>might have been in part inspired by <span>Michelle Alexander<sup>[2]</sup></span>'s "<span>The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness<sup>[3]</sup></span>".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That goes into more detail,<br>about the prison industry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very difficult to spot the companies that are making money,<br>because most of them will put up beautiful messages about keeping families connected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How <em>not to</em> appreciate that kind of work,<br>and dedication and foresight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because these companies, do nothing to prevent crime,<br>they position themselves to feed on families that were just ripped apart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See normal people would make this communication free,<br>the real super-predators say <em>PLAYS</em></div>
  <div class="paragraph">There would be no moneymaking here,<br>no premium communication programs, no we need your credit card first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A normal person would never think of making money here,<br>but a evil person bates people into signing up with a free weekly phone call - an option which didn't originally exist, according to their website.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please note how hard it is to see the evil behind all this,<br>on the surface, and even beneath the surface, there is no visible wrong doing here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me try break this down for you,<br>above all, prison does not make people better, and human beings get ill from sitting in cages.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prisons shouldn't exist, falling apart to a point of committing a crime is a psychological crisis,<br>individual who are in that state need a doctor and a psychologist, they need support, love and understanding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Additionally, <span>non-violent crimes should not result in a prison sentence<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and a jury of well off white suburbians who never faced the street, or slept behind a trash container, and who don't want to be in court, is not a real jury.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also wan to single out addiction, and drug possession, as a psychological problem,<br>it is not a crime, it is an illness - punishing a drug addict with prison is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though public defenders are the heroes here, they are overloaded, and can't handle the persecution,<br>which has more resources than they need, and <span>incredible new powers such as geo fencing, that arises from what should be illegal-mass-surveillance<sup>[5]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until convicted, a person should not put into jail or prison,<br>and in court, they should be able to chose a legal firm, including the most prestigious ones, and this would cost them nothing - because money and justice does not mix.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Addressing prisons and crime, is actually very little,<br>these repairs that I have mentioned here merely correct mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What we need is prevention,<br>and that means universal income, or free money, or a bottomless credit card with nothing more than a daily limit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where will crime be, when everyone is given a credit card with a hundred dollar daily spending limit,<br>it will pay for rent, for food, for computer, books, for books, for 3D printers, and other temporary curiosities that expand the mind, that help us grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where will the gas station robberies be,<br>where even the most desperate person in the world will have money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, we laugh at the idea of free money,<br>but tolerate the idea that some people need prison, for doing things that keep their heads from falling apart from... poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why, growing all the way up,<br>and adding to the momentum with which Humanity is advancing must be one of the most important things on our mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing acceptable about the disproportionate mass incarceration of people fractured by poverty,<br>and there is nothing wrong, with ending poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than putting in an effort into collecting phone sensor data for the purposes,<br>of catching all the criminals in the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just need to put effort into preventing crime,<br>by ending poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And by ending poverty, we also end wage slavery, we also end businesses that that make money,<br>off of moms needing to talk to their sons, who suffered poverty on a degree that pushed them into addiction, a punishment that is no doubt far greater than any prison.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By ending poverty we give people time,<br>to think, to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We give the children time to grow up,<br>without fracturing from poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The problem of mass incarceration become so great,<br>that we have begun decriminalizing drugs to keep children out of prison.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that also sends the wrong message, it sends the message of using drugs and alcohol to treat problems that arise from the global state of poverty,<br>chemically induced productivity, no slaver could ask for more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Along with decriminalization of drugs, we must also remove the need for them<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>World Poverty must end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By not ending world poverty,<br>we are enslaving the future generations to all these broken ideas, and then some.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To begin today, all we have to do,<br>is help the children understand that prisons are wrong, that using money to keep wall street and military rich, and people poor - is madness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must stop acting in a way that indoctrinates children into this culture of injustice,<br>the shortest path there, is to help children to the great and life changing narrated books at the local library, books like "<span>The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness<sup>[7]</sup></span>"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And above all help them reject fake or ineffective education,<br>and understand that that Knowledge begets Wisdom, and Wisdom begets Greatness.</div>
