      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Road Towards Authentic Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Subject divisions in schools are perfectly broken,<br>they reflect nothing about education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A room labeled Calculus,<br>that imbues students with calculus, is a stupid fantasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It comes into being on the wings of people that either,<br>pretend to have an education, or don't realize that they are uneducated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It starts with politics, mayors, principals,<br>and teachers that are aware of the word programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It lines the pockets of both textbook manufacturers,<br>and those that produce materials for teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The company behind the programming language,<br>will lie, cheat, and steal, to later charge the graduates for using the language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The company associated with the computers or operating system,<br>will make a bunch, to say the least.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Over the course of few semesters,<br>the teachers memorize what to say, what to do, how to tweak tests, etc.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you enter the classroom,<br>and become forced into tricking yourself into thinking you found a shortcut.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers that can't teach, will make the material more abstract,<br>to force you into memorization, and you forget programming with your last test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program you are making at the end of the semester,<br>if it is something you can't sell, then the class is fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, many teachers would check me,<br>and say, but you can't possibly accomplish that in a single semester.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You probably can, but, yes,<br>the semesters are too short.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The class cannot end until everyone serious about programming,<br>is selling multiple copies of their program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is one of several broken ways of learning,<br>school want you to memorize and get a job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools can't educate you,<br>as education id a deeply Beautiful and Personal thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your education is exactly as unique as you,<br>and there is a <strong>system</strong> of self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am very sorry that this is somewhat costly,<br>even if you never get it all working, you will still know that you could.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you only buy it after you learn the software,<br>by which time it won't be an expense but a necessity, like a functional heater.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What I am showing you here is a group of related things,<br>that mutually reinforce one another, and burst with knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually you may need to consider purchasing <span>Creality Ender 3 V2 3D Printer<sup>[1]</sup></span> priced at <span>$300<sup>[2]</sup></span> dollars,<br>and the <span>Creality Ender CR Touch Auto Bed Leveling Sensor Kit<sup>[3]</sup></span> priced at <span>$40 dollars<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You only pay for the hardware, the software is free, the reason why the hardware is so important here,<br>is that you will be able to create real things straight from your imagination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To design your objects, <span>you will need to take the Doughnut Tutorial<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br><span>followed by the Precision Modeling in Blender series<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally, <span>familiarize yourself, with using the Prusa Slicer with your Ender printer<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>visit Thingverse to get an idea what people are printing<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In conclusion, I want you to notice the difference between what I presented here,<br>and what schools and maybe <span>others are trying to convince you of<sup>[9]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you finish the tutorials, in the peace and privacy of your home,<br>you will be able to print out anything you can imagine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you participate in fake education,<br>you get nothing back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is a function of fake education to rob you of your genius,<br>to trick you into thinking that you didn't get anything out of fake education, because you are not good enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The real reason why you are not getting anything out of those things,<br>is because fraudulent systems aren't able to produce anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if you don't by the printer,<br>and only peek at the tutorials, you can still use this as a magnificent measuring stick, and a guide to model you next lesson in self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Next time you pay for something or take a class,<br>ask yourself if you will get something real in return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And you have to expect real results from a class<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>because having memorized some formulas or created a useless program, will do nothing for you because of the speed with which life moves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education provides breathtaking results, fake education, keeps promising until the promises don't matter anymore,<br>as your employer ask you to forget everything you learned, and tells you what you need to know, and finally replaces you with cheaper employees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being tricked out of real education is a terrible curse,<br>I encourage you to independent self education, and relentless, life long search for wisdom and greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that all your lessons are breathtaking and magical,<br>and grant you amazing new powers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let anybody trick you,<br>if it provides no results, or incoherent results, it is not real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to be passionate about what you have learned,<br>you are meant gain great wisdom, and you are meant to become a great being.</div>
