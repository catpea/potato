  <div class="paragraph">The opposite of employment isn't unemployment. It's freedom.<br>-- G.K. Chesterton, writer, philosopher, and art critic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Peace,<br>is about wisdom.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We need a new international bank,<br>an upgrade to the way individual beings use money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bank card has a daily spending limit of $100 United Stated Dollars,<br>that sum will grow with inflation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While the bank should not track debt because a Human Being is a creator,<br>and not a burden.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Should those figures prove a necessity the money can from the surrounding planets,<br>the bank, simply sells and trades land and mineral rights.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is is important to understand that this money is an investment in the future of Human Kind,<br>because the only real thing that divides us; is poverty and all the things it induces, including lack of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human made things such as money,<br>must always aim to help us, not hurt us.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The result,<br>ends poverty and <span>wage slavery<sup>[1]</sup></span>, setting us free to learn and become wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The effects of wage slavery,<br>are real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most miserable one,<br>is mass incarceration of people who are fractured by poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The host harmful effect,<br>is lack of education and growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, you have to exit education,<br>and get a job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then, you will not learn the things you need to know to grow great,<br>because you will be too tired from overwork, and of work, and petty nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though there is no conspiracy to create wage slavery,<br>you are still being cut off from education, forced into work, and denied a full measure of wisdom you deserve.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot have a justice system,<br>when people are committing crimes our of poverty and lack of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The errors within our civilization,<br>are putting people in cages - that is not justice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We simply cannot have a civilization based on using poverty to force people out school and into work,<br>this is not who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here in lies the problem of sequence,<br>without real education, we can't see the errors that surround us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With our love for all members of the human family stunted,<br>we can't even comprehend the gravity of the necessity of this change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education,<br>Humanity will not notice the invisible prison walls of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Without real education, we will silently standby the death of 20,000 people<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and in out blindness call that; a method of prevention.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Entry into authentic education, and a global exit from poverty,<br>is the only way to permanently prevent the fracturing, indoctrination, warping, and hijacking-the-minds of poor and uneducated people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One hundred dollars per day to all,<br>so that they may outgrow in wisdom their fathers, families, cultures, indoctrination, propaganda, lies, manipulations; and avoid fractures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Let their fathers cry<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>once they understand that their children will be growing up in a better world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That their children won't have to fight, or fear hunger,<br>that they can just move and take to the constellations of curiosities within them.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is not just Universal Income, you see,<br>it is also Real Education, so that the world, can see it self.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Today when you ask a teacher,<br>who do they see when they look at you, their honest answer is a student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you are not just a student,<br>you are all our hopes and dreams.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you ask why they are teaching you,<br>their honest answer is so that they can put food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is all about empowering you,<br>to greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when you ask them about war,<br>they will say that the world is not a fair place, that war is what men do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, they are victims of lack of real education, victims of poverty,<br>and they are trapped within the invisible walls, of work or perish.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This cycle of blindness, destruction, and self-destruction must be broken,<br>it must END right now, this second.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of teachers,<br>you become a teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must take to self education,<br>because a standardized curriculum can't teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At best it can only churn out uneducated and desperate work machines,<br>who can't understand that only Real Education and Safety and Security can prevent conflict...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not mutually assured destruction, not drone strikes,<br>not another arms race.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Drone strikes and other modern technologies<br>simply accelerated the arms race and emergence of new conflicts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humans are not work machines,<br>when we are allowed to grow, we grow into great beings.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Take to narrated books<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>help others do the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as we are learning,<br>the world education level will rise high enough to make that strange bank a reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the people will understand that what divided us,<br>was the fractures from poverty and lack of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Freed from poverty and converging on wisdom,<br>people will begin to understand that we are one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One family,<br>under the sun.</div>
