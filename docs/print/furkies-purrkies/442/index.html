    </div>

    <p>We are alike biologically,<br>and socially we are a single family.</p>
<p>Intellectually,<br>we are each unique.</p>
<p>Boys thinking that beer is a rite of passage, or a person assuming that they belong to a particular religion,<br>are both examples of making the mistake, of thinking, that we are like others.</p>
<p>We are nothing,<br>like the others, nothing.</p>
<p>The price Humanity pays for this mistake,<br>is the tragic repetition of all the other mistakes, including those that should never be repeated.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are nothing like the others,<br>a conscious creature is by definition, unique and free.</p>
<p>There is wisdom that Humanity transfers between generations,<br>in the shape of the mainstream culture, and it is good to learn from.</p>
<p>This is a wisdom that the majority votes on,<br>by doing things that they most fulfillment and happiness in.</p>
<p>But not everything in the mainstream is correct,<br>and it is your job to remove the things that are not worthy of you.</p>
<p>Often times, all it takes, is asking,<br>what if I was born somewhere else, or what would the Earth look to imaginary great beings from Mars.</p>
<hr>
<p>Loneliness and isolation are torture,<br>but cheaply belonging somewhere is not the path out of it.</p>
<p>To belong to something,<br>is to work hard to earn your spot.</p>
<p>Not to say that you have to torture yourself to get there,<br>as when you aim for greatness, each step is a great reward.</p>
<p>What the small minded don't understand,<br>is that it is not the aim, and not just the journey, but also your transformation as you adapt to the challenges in your way.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that life will end,<br>there is a possibility that medicine will soon-enough prolong life indefinitely.</p>
<p>You cannot assume, that you are only aiming to be 95 plus,<br>because that maybe the day you will be granted an opportunity to roll back the clock to when you were 40.</p>
<p>Living life, and making excuses that you will die of old age anyway,<br>is not how it is done, nor is this a thought <em>worthy</em> of a Noble Human.</p>
<hr>
<p>You have to grow your own way,<br>you have to recognize that you are perfectly unique.</p>
<p>Do listen to the mainstream,<br>as the choices that billions of people across countless cultures make are often very wise choices.</p>
<p>Do not try to join a group,<br>of hold up one - that you were merely born into - above all others.</p>
<p>The groups that you want to belong to, deal with Human Greatness,<br>they require knowledge, wisdom, and greatness of heart.</p>
<p>Even if humans never invent medicine to indefinitely prolong life,<br>you are still charged with becoming immortal by leaving a clear legacy of future generations.</p>
<hr>
<p>Humanity has not yet progressed to a level where it can slow down or stand still,<br>it must continue bettering it self, it must continue developing.</p>
<p>The only way that Humanity can truly progress,<br>is when every human being accepts the responsibility for Real Education and Meaningful Knowledge, and Wisdom.</p>
<p>That means you are tasked with becoming a Great Being,<br>and you will not develop your greatness by merely following.</p>
<p>That Greatness that the World, and the Future, and our Human Family, is asking of you,<br>is the highest and noblest expression of your uniqueness that can only stem from a lifetime of relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>I repeat one more time,<br>do not make the mistake of thinking that you are anything like everybody else.</p>
