      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Right Angle: The Biggest Problem In Art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Face recognition,<br>sometimes photos don't capture the right angle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we know someone personally,<br>we recognize them based on a series of angles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a photo,<br>we only get one angle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what is worse,<br>lenses can distort the face even more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As well as software trying to be helpful,<br>and even the scene, the focus, the colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, a person's expression,<br>can alter their appearance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the last thing you need,<br>is your art creating a sense of distance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And not closeness,<br>as it is intended.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Photogrammetry with neutral lighting,<br>that allows for customizing the angle and light source later, mayyybe, is one way to do it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>This also means that a scanned portrait can be printed in 3D<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>the software <span>Meshroom<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>Blender<sup>[3]</sup></span> and <span>Prusa Slicer<sup>[4]</sup></span> is all free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the oldest solution,<br>is best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means you have to see the person you are going to paint, in 3D,<br>it won't take you very long to understand their main angle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that although your painting will be based on a single photo,<br>you will need several minutes of video.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And few dozen photos at slightly different angles,<br>and in different lighting conditions.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It can be quite an experience to go from having seen one,<br>to multiple photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, it may seem,<br>that the first couple of photos show two different people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sisters, lookalikes,<br>and definitely not the same person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I call this,<br>the biggest problem in art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Painting,<br>the wrong, "twin".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I would like to underline that stylized paintings,<br>are just as precious as hyperrealistic ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, reducing an eye down to a stylized version,<br>while retaining the correct appearance of a person, will take a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially when taking your first steps away from Hyperrealism,<br>you will get stuck here - but this - is not a problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is your education,<br>the point where you are getting stuck is your next milestone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the reason why you are getting stuck,<br>is because even a realistic stylized appearance, is an illustration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is no longer a photo, where you are conquering light,<br>now, you are assembling a perfected eye, component by component.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not meant to be,<br>a source of frustration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Building your first bridge of knowledge,<br>between Breathtaking Hyperrealism, and Enchanting Beautiful Stylization...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will surely become,<br>one of your most memorable journeys.</div>
