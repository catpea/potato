  <div class="paragraph">On Dignity And Classiness: Preface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I must clarify ahead of time, that the word class that I use here,<br>has been misused in history, and as a result has a dark past.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, we need that word back, we have lost the Noble Knight, we have lost The Gentle Lady and the Gentleman,<br>even the word Officer has lost prestige.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the young people need a way to say:<br>"I won't fight you, because you lack class.", they need to be able to say "I am too classy for that, you jerks" and not do something stupid that everybody else did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cornel West whom I feature in this poem, uses the word Ennobled,<br>and I hope that word will return to our daily language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of saying "This woman has class",<br>it would be much more beautiful in my opinion to say "This woman is ennobled by her deeds."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is not how we use language today,<br>so we will use the word class here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The aim of this poem is not to divide Humanity anymore than it already is,<br>but to help us converge together on wisdom, with Great Class and Dignity.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">On Dignity And Classiness</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dignity is complicated as it has multiple facets or sides,<br>it means and it is less of a rule and more of an armour.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Class, starts of as the behaviors you inherited from all that surrounds you,<br>I think frequently this is not enough to progress and grow up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And certainly you want to inherit the class of great beings.<br>the class of a citizen of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Great Beings are people that truly change the world for better,<br>and citizens of the world are those who are not divided by borders, religions or beliefs, but converge together on wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Class and Dignity, grows with us, it is dynamic,<br>our minds are doing everything to make sure that we feel whole, but that is not good for those who transform.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If a person that has undergone a transformation, is still scarred by the past,<br>they are making a mistake, and need help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who are growing up, who are transforming,<br>must frequently ask, if they would still make the mistake they once made...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the answer is no,<br>then they are different person from who they once were, and they need to stop blaming themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See Class and Dignity may sound simple,<br>but actually they reach deeply into a Human Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Cornel West<sup>[1]</sup></span>, in the opening of <span>Astra Taylor's Examined Life<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>captures the subject beautifully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mr. West could maybe say that everything we do is a mistake,<br>it is in correcting those mistakes that we find greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we will not speak like this,<br>not everyone makes mistakes, and those who do need to check if they have changed, and let themselves be free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we are taught that there is such a thing as Precious Dignity, and Evil Poverty,<br>we will not allow the sickness of poverty take our dignity away, we will not rob, or sell drugs, or worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will stop and ask, "Who made this poverty?", "Why are we in it?",<br>and we will learn from fools onward to becoming wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not everyone of us can leap into Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,<br>precisely because they are being held back by poverty, or violence, or crime, or all the other terrible things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But having been made aware that we can rise to have more class in life,<br>that we have dignity that others may try to take, in order to turn us into some tool, or make a fool - and that we must protect it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creates a stepping stone,<br>maybe a starting point.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here young people can ignore drugs and alcohol and other stupid ideas,<br>understanding that dignity is a treasure, that it is something that their elder selves will appreciate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And transcendence of class, be it a class that holds bullies in high esteem, or corrupt politicians,<br>or sees drugs and alcohol as fun, - leaving that behind, is a sure path to more knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To improve ones class, is to inherit it from Great Beings that we admire,<br>and that inheritance requires the reading of books, or listening to narrated books from the library.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Interestingly, at first, it does not always matter what the books are about,<br>it is not so much the content, but the kind of thinking that Great Beings do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what getting more class is about,<br>spending time among the great beings to understand who they are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once we have the who:<br>the great beings, their companionship, and their class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will be ready for the what,<br>the things they are attempting to share or achieve.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To think in terms of dignity,<br>is to grant ourselves the opportunity to say no, even to our best friends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To say:<br>"No, because my dignity is more important, then some stupid, temporary shit, that the elder me will end up regretting later on.".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To think in terms of class,<br>is to ask, many questions, and even to begin comprehending that unfortunate people may have their freedom of will taken away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What is the best class?", "How do I get there?",<br>and most importantly "Why was I not born to it?", "What went wrong and where?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Does a person who uses violence have class?",<br>"Are they truly themselves, when they lack class? Class that is their right, that is their inheritance, and treasure, their beauty and prestige.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If they transcended to the class of Great Beings,<br>what would they think of their younger selves?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even the cute and silly question that one may ask themselves in the morning:<br>"Am I Classy?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(I can answer that one for you, Yes you are! You are classy!,<br>say it with me: "I am classy, and sassy.")</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, use dignity to draw a line that no one is allowed to cross,<br>and use class as a path towards understanding, towards Knowledge and resulting Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.</div>
