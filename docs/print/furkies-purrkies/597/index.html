  <div class="paragraph">Is it always nice to have all the friends,<br>it depends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you will never regret,<br>advice that you never forget.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most powerful advice I ever got,<br>was from biographies that I bought.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Alex The Supertramp taught me,<br>that I <span>can't be free on a bended knee<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">J. Maarten Troost showed me that I was right,<br>to ignore friends with a stupid appetite.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Stay away from alcohol and every kind of brew<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and he put it smartly too:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If you hang around a barbershop long enough, you'll eventually get a haircut".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A very touching wisdom came from <span>Charles Kuralt's book<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>where instead of giving a homeless lady his groceries, he merely gave her a look.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">His regret has always made me deeply sad,<br>but that I won't make the same mistake makes me glad.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It just to happens that some of the wisest people we meet,<br>will be in the books we get as a treat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wise advice is never hated,<br>and popular books sell well as they are celebrated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look to bestsellers, the biographies that come up first,<br>are rarely the worst.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Biographies that humanity finds wise enough,<br>are precious though sometimes can be tough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we will remember these stories as if they were told by a friend,<br>we adopt the wisdom and whatever else we can comprehend.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of books out there,<br>and all you need is a chair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you make some room to listen or read every day,<br>they will replace your shyness with knowing what to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And your words will flow from within,<br>like the pretty melody of a violin.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow you are sure to revisit your book friends,<br>and see their adventures through an even wiser lens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies are special because they help us avoid entire zones,<br>countless troubles and unknowns.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can all look up lists of <span>Fallacies<sup>[4]</sup></span>, <span>Biases<sup>[5]</sup></span>, and <span>Misconceptions<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>but that is too dry to instantly influence our perceptions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A biography comes from the soul and heart,<br>it is an instantly touching piece of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need a story that was lived through,<br>a story that is human and true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is what biographies are for,<br>wisdom, foresight, adventure, and more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They help us get to wisdom sooner rather than later,<br>and help us become greater.</div>
