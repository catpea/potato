    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Junk DNA Accumulates,<br>and so do the beneficial changes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They come from the fundamental principles of nature,<br>of physics and chemistry, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is something we can feel and touch,<br>this is something we can see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially since we each begun as a single cell,<br>both in the primordial sense and prior to our mitosis.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Junk also accumulates in our cultures and by extension our minds,<br>on top of that, most of the beneficial changes require some effort as they have to begin inside out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We think that thinking is automatic,<br>but that is just our minds being beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thinking is an intentional process,<br>you have to try to think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The automatic route is a lot of trouble,<br>and we are NOT that kind of creature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are each meant for Greatness,<br>not for submission, or servitude, or suffering, or struggling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Religions, Failed Nations, Liars, Manipulators, Criminals,<br>want us to submit, they want us to serve, they want us to find meaning in suffering, they want us to struggle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is fools gold,<br>we are each to become Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we can easily achieve that by simply entering the culture of Great Beings,<br>by spending time with them; by means of befriending them in their books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please, understand! you don't have to <strong>read</strong> books,<br>you can listen to their narrated versions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Listening is actually much better,<br><span>especially if you take to the trails<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people who laugh at you for listening to books,<br>they hope to use you, and own you, they want you to be as stupid as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are neither friend,<br>nor family,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't approach philosophy directly,<br>first learn about the lives of the authors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then before listening to their works,<br>read study guides to get the maximum out of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books are the only way,<br>the urge to read, the the change that follows must come from within you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you fail to transform,<br><span>especially when you are unlucky enough to be born to a life of violence or crime<sup>[2]</sup></span> by sheer accident, keep trying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For those of us who don't get into any trouble,<br>the transformation into the culture of greatness is still critical as it marks the rite of passage into adulthood.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is far too dangerous to assume that we were the lucky ones and our culture is just fine,<br>that is how everyone ends up having their freedom of will subverted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human beings are Beautiful,<br>but all too often mislead, almost always mislead, almost always used in one way or another.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to me, one of our greatest treasures and inventions, our most sacred thing,<br>created invented/thousands of years before religions, was <span>The Transformation<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The transformation took us from whatever we were born into, and it helped us to become great beings<sup>[4]</sup></span>.<br>and we still need it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know your firs instinct is to fight for the culture you were born into,<br>but that is only because you don't see the full picture - too much of what you were born into is clouding your judgment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't tell you who you are, because part of the definition of a human being is that we are each unique,<br>you are noting like anybody else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And your friends or acquaintances would freak the heck out,<br>if someone similar to you tried to replace you in school, they would notice that something was wrong immediately.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't be like anybody else,<br>we are just too different from each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are bombarded by unique experiences non-stop,<br>as far as growing up goes, nobody can tell you who you are, the best they can say is that you are different from everybody else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when it comes to starting out, just take the safe route,<br>and assume that you have been indoctrinated into a culture that is less the the culture of Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Indoctrination is such a frequent and invisible problem,<br>that for tens of thousands of years, we would start life by taking a journey into the unknown to find ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are rules to this transformation, sometimes people don't read the right books,<br>they return being indoctrinates into something else, or having made more mistakes due to still having their judgment clouded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All that means is that they are still in the same place they started,<br>it means there was no transformation, they need to try again, and maybe again, as many times as it takes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only transformation that counts,<br>is the transformation into the culture of Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The real thing only happens once,<br>mums need not be scared about watching their babes change in such profound ways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The changes that follow will be subtle,<br>they will be connected, mutually reinforcing, they strengthen, enlighten, embolden - they set the child on the path towards greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing. our beginnings are almost always rooted in a culture that does not do us justice,<br>our growing up must begin by transitioning into a culture of Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You enter the culture of greatness,<br>by befriending the Great Beings in their books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Afterword:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A local hardware store had a big bin of books,<br>for a reason that I still don't understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And somehow, I started finding books about UFO/s in there,<br>at first I must admit that I was not sure what to think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But after some consideration,<br>I realized that strange stories that follow a similar pattern is how cults and religions start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once I realized these books were a shared fantasy,<br>I totally lost interest in them - but I kept that insight into religions and cults.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Next, I took to science books,<br>I love how Science Popularizes explain everything so clearly, how it is all coherent and colorful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I was never a religious person,<br>it seemed too strange to me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the online bookstore "Other listeners also bought" feature suggested to me <span>Julia Sweeney's Letting Go Of God<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>I gave her book a listen because of her humour, and how pretty her voice is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is where I met Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris,<br>and although what they had to say was no surprise to me, the way they carried themselves, their behavior was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I realized the books and people I stumbled upon,<br>were Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was packing for a trip, just having done listening to <span>We Are All Connected<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>which later ended up as the soundtrack to the trip, due to a mighty storm that provided the visuals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I sat on my stairs quietly,<br>listening to the girls cheering and laughing in the background to Richard's amazing class, as he was giving a speech at <span>Randolph-Macon Woman's College<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I especially love how he said a cult of female gods would have improving effects<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>there was so much love in the audience - it was all so beautiful to me - and he is so classy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This woman asked a feminist question, and Richard was ready with the answer,<br>but then in his class, his classiness, he added that additional part, stating that female gods would have improving effects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ever since,<br>I have stayed in their company, slowly inheriting their culture by just admiring them and their works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why I write poems about Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,<br>these are not elitist things, this is who we are, who we become when we unplug from problems in other people's heads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must stop making other people's lives easier,<br>and start growing all the way up to become Great Beings... because that is our right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is where we all need to move towards,<br>that is what will keep our minds strong and healthy,<br>that is what our elder-selves would ask for,<br>that is what will keep our minds of harms way,<br>that is what will make the world laugh,<br>and that is what will keep it moving and advancing forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What follows is a very short list of amazing people,<br>that could perhaps help you in your amazing journeys.</div>
