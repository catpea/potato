      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Fun Little Road Towards Inventing New Things</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not easy to figure out if you are an inventor or not,<br>and it is all to easy to judge ourselves by lack of ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I believe we are all inventors,<br>but I know a lot of people have their curiosities elsewhere.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>3D printing is an amazing tool and it is not hard to learn<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>and 3D modeling is not as intimidating as it sounds<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While inventing does not always have to end in sales,<br><span>even something as simple as Loki's Horns may bring in $300,000<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Making a little bit of money along the way,<br>can be a neat motivational force and a fun reward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>There are 3D printers that have a conveyor belt instead of a platter<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>so as long as they are fed filament, they will just keep printing day and night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I often mention 3D printing because it is a powerful example,<br>of self education, creativity and invention.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there are many other areas that are worth exploring,<br>some can still produce physical objects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example ordering cut sheet metal from a local company,<br>can result in <span>sheet metal survival kits<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Using a drawing robot with a brush and canvas<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br><span>can create very interesting little paintings<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But physical products can be trouble,<br>and can cause worry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are some exceptions such as <span>printing on demand<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>which applies to both books and 3D printed objects and jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they hint on the simplest approach to inventing to inventing new things,<br>and that is dealing with digital things, even if just images.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example <span>selling photos of wood grains to graphic designers<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>can become quite an adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You would need to search for beautiful textures,<br>and just take photos and share and sell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There may not be a lot of money in digital sales,<br>but it is a fantastic stepping store towards becoming an inventor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Making just a few dollars with a unique idea,<br>can be all you need to launch you on a path towards becoming an inventor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond Photography, to continue the example above,<br>you will find programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More specifically automatically generating interesting backgrounds,<br>or <span>Generative Art<sup>[10]</sup></span> as it is called.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is one of many interesting ways,<br>to get started with programming and <span>graphic programming<sup>[11]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you can imagine you don't have to generate 2D graphics,<br>you can take your knowledge of graphic programming right back to 3D printing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And automatically generate 3D art,<br>so what begins as selling some photos, and abstract art, can take you to an entirely unexplored area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Abstract 3D sculptures,<br>that never repeat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The path towards invention is about creating something,<br>with flexible tools that won't hold you back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">3D Modeling, Drawing-Robots, Digital Photography, and Programming,<br>are all example of flexible tools that can get you started.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you don't have to start with an invention,<br>you just need to start by creating anything, for sale, display, or just fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Invention, is found in the act of improving your favorite creations,<br>of dreaming up ways to make them more useful, or better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you are creating,<br>you never get stuck inventing.</div>
