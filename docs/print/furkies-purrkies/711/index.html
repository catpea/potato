  <div class="paragraph">Off the top of my head I can think of,<br>Krita's Reference Image Picking, <span>Wall Projectors<sup>[1]</sup></span>, <span>Graphite Paper<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>Tracing<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>Pouncing<sup>[4]</sup></span>, <span>Dark Room<sup>[5]</sup></span>, and <span>Perspectographs<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All of this techniques,<br>are beautiful and ingenious - and they are art.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Krita, has a feature called Reference Images Tool,<br>and when you stretch a reference image over your entire canvas, and make it invisible by setting opacity to 1 percent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something magical happens,<br>and this thing give you the superpower to become an artist right now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reference layer is a layer above all other layers,<br>it lives in its own untouchable universe above all else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you have an invisible reference image stretched over your canvas,<br>the color picker won't care that the opacity is just 1 percent - it will only pick colors from the reference layer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means when you use a color picker, even in an empty area of your canvas,<br>you will pick the REAL color from the reference image, even though the opacity of the reference image is at 1 percent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Press "B" to switch to your brush tool, and when you need a real color,<br>just hold control and pick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though your canvas maybe empty, or pink like mine always is,<br>it does not matter, yo still get the real color from your invisible reference image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a superpower that would make, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo,<br>quit.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can open up your own Art Studio,<br>and sell perfect portraits while you study and master adding extra beauty to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you feel that art is not in the trace,<br>then it is surely in what you do to and around it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I assure you, tracing portraits is it,<br>tracing is also a magnificent teacher.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a second point I should try to note here,<br>when you begin tracing it becomes the loveliest teacher - that can take you from beginner on up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please don't start with copying by eye, or some hand-eye-coordination practice,<br>there are other lessons to be had first - and you find them all in tracing.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Order an inexpensive (about $40) pen and tablet,<br>and take a <span>Krita Tutorial<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And begin taking commissions,<br>be it a week a month or a year, or a decade, or several - we need to create art the same way that we need to leave our journals behind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our art is an important picture of our soul,<br>one that is worth a million unspoken words, when all there is left is journals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to art, make Photo Realism your first step,<br>and then travel countless many more.</div>
