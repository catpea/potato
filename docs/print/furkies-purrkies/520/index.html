  <div class="paragraph">Today I wrote three poems, first about inspiration to wisdom,<br>second about meaningful education, and third about the first two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every once in a while I have to turn myself around,<br>because even thought I am not rhyming, these poems still steer themselves.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I simply want to write about,<br>what to draw, what to paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Choosing inspiration for art is a lot of trouble,<br>for one, it is just not possible to use a random picture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be connected to something inspiring,<br>and you have to be the one to take the reference photo.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going from place to place in search for inspiration,<br>can often result in never finding anything at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is a huge problem,<br>because without inspiration to art ... you can't create art.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One time at the college,<br>everyone was asked to hurry out of the class room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I realized,<br>a naked model was preparing to pose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remembered how the teachers assistant, pointed at a small seemingly comfortable bar stool,<br>made a face that I've never seen before, and muttered "I would never sit on this".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The last thing I saw before leaving the classroom,<br>was the teacher plastering paper over the glass portholes in the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the model wishes to celebrate beauty that's fine,<br>but a strange stranger does nothing to inspire the artist.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think it is Frankl's description of success that gets it right:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"...success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;<br>it must ensue, and it only does so,<br>as the unintended side effect<br>of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself..."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So it maybe that the search for art inspiration,<br>must be a by-product of something greater.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I can't think of anything more colorful, right now,<br>then the things one discovers on little adventures.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is no telling what a little adventure is,<br>but if I was pressed to describe one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would say that a little adventure,<br>is going somewhere somewhat within a walking distance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of my adventures that I adore,<br>is taking a long lonesome walk across the city of Plymouth, in Michigan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up in an old bookstore,<br>and all the way in the back, on the bottom shelf, tucked atop a dusty cardboard box filled with magazines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sat the <span>Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millamn<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>it is not a perfect book, they rarely ever are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But read it in a single go,<br>and it kindled my life long love for Antique Stores and Knickknacks and Trinkets, and bookstore cats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That in my book,<br>is a perfect adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Had I been an Artist back then,<br>I would have taken a nice photo of the bookstore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I would use an office projector to project it on a few sheets of drawing paper,<br>and a couple of large canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do a couple sketches at the site,<br>probably work on a painting, though I would do the under-painting at home and wait for the oils to dry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd sign my name with a Kitty Cat drawing,<br>and leave one of my paintings at the books store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Th inspiration for the painting would be lots of things,<br>I'd wait for a person to give the now finished Peaceful Warrior book to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd try pastries from various coffee shops in the area,<br>talk to strangers, sit on the bench, and maybe wait for the autumn to roll in.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is your work of art,<br>you don't need to find inspiration that inspires the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just need the inspiration,<br>that inspires you to a new work of art.</div>
