    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was always pretty much convinced that Shuffle Dancing for an hour almost every day,<br>is just as good as running a 10K.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Initially I suspected that dancing was actually more powerful,<br>but I wanted to wait for the middle of summer to test it, with what I call a Cold Turkey 10K.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cold Turkey means you don't practice jogging beforehand,<br>just grab some light dumbbells and start jogging, until you reach 10K.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Things I wished I had with me were my bandannas, or bracers as I call them,<br>I wrap them around my wrists to wipe the sweat from my forehead, so that it does not get into my eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please note, that if sweat does get into your eyes and does not sting a little,<br>that could be a sign of an electrolyte imbalance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some people emphasize that the body <em>very unwisely</em> gets rid of salt during exercise,<br>and my doctor recently mentioned that an electrolyte imbalance can kill.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I mean imbalance,<br>that means too much salt is just as bad, as too little.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I grabbed my dumbbells and stormed out the door forgetting my woolen socks,<br>I am not 100% sure that woolen socks prevent blisters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they certainly create that perfect shoe,<br>where the foot is isolated from the shoe by a thick layer of wool.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't check how long I ran, because I was already late to start,<br>but about 5K, half way through, the sun started going down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I finished in the dark, it is probably wise to bring a head lamp,<br>because socks or no socks the one thing you don't want to do is step into something squishy by the side of the road.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, your visibility and safety greatly improves,<br>when you start looking like a bouncy bicycle from afar.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I forgot my phone, like this was 1999,<br>also, I forgot my phone number, though in my defense I never tried to memorize it in the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I forgot to squirt myself with bug replant,<br>even though nothing bit me, I really regret it, because I love that smell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And my dumbbells are too clunky, the jog is over two hours long,<br>so the hands get tired, and it is awesome! to lift the dumbbells over the head, or just move them around in general.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The smaller and more rubbery, and easier to grasp in the palm of your hand,<br>the better, I just had 7.5 or 10lb in each hand (I have a modular kit, and I am uncertain how much the connecting rod weighs).</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>I converted my 10K backpack to a Halloween costume last year<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>so I didn't bring water - I didn't get thirsty - but not bringing water along was not a good idea..</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also don't recommend plain water, but something sugary,<br>you don't need expensive gels, you need a caffeine-free soft drink.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My doctor says and I quote "Coffee is good for you",<br>but I don't like the threat of headaches looming over my head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While I don't discourage people from drinking coffee,<br>I think it makes endurance exercise more difficult, and I avoid it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I recently found out that Ginger Soda is caffeine free,<br>and that is what I wish I had with me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I know that everyone always says that,<br>"You can't outrun a donuts", but that means nothing to me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Outrunning donuts, or to be more precise Vernors and a Hershey's Cookies and Creme White Chocolate bar,<br>is why I exercise, I am also trying to outrun all the ones I had before, I started exercising, and it is going great.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I mention all those things to let you know what to keep an out on,<br>but overall, jogging is meant to be easy, you just need shoes, running shorts, and music on your phone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">It has been about an hour since I arrived,<br>and I feel nothing but standard tiredness of a workout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, my finding is that and hour of Shuffle Dancing is equal, if not better than slow 2 hour 10K,<br>and I base this on my breathing, utter lack of aches or concerns during the jog, and not really feeling challenged by a slow 10K at all (this is a new feeling for me)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would like to add that I had a bug... um, that swallowed it self, or had it self swallowed,<br>because I certainly wasn't trying to gulp it with the air; and that is never a concern during my <span>Shuffle Dancing<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
