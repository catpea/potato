  <div class="paragraph">Ayn Rand says solve your contradictions,<br>check your premises and convictions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think this is just a start,<br>even as a teenager I used to say that life is art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is all about an integrated mind,<br>in which all our knowledge is perfectly aligned.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Most schools teach an educational mix,<br>but those lessons are just stupid tricks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the good teachers have been cheated,<br>they've been fired and out-competed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools sell the idea of balanced education,<br>but those words mark the death of every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Balanced education is a meme,<br>a virus that will kill every dream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Balanced sounds really good,<br>but this can ruin adulthood.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even students will protect it with all their might,<br>never realizing, it is a blight.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Just imagine what would happen to Newton's mind,<br>he would have gone numb, mad, and blind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A mix of ingredients ruins an education,<br>as our minds depend on a fixed constellation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A mind without connections,<br>cannot set correct directions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We graduate school convinced we know math,<br>but only the self taught can follow that path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a horrible curse as many think; they know,<br>but their abilities fade as soon as they give something a go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you focus on the final result,<br>school will seem much like a cult.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students are pretending to know,<br>and the teachers let them graduate and go.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A lot of it is about money and food on the table,<br>money makes the school unstable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before we get money out of politics,<br>to rid of all those bloodsucking ticks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to get money out of corrupt schools,<br>and into student hands, as today they are being used as mere tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here a self paced an self organized education,<br>will lead them to build start-ups with little hesitation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That air of students reaching success,<br>will create a beautiful educational madness.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Once a student has a reason and direction,<br>they will build a path hat will afford them safety and protection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of asking: what do I do to graduate,<br>they will begin asking: what do I need to learn to create.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lesson connected to lesson they will advance,<br>all they need is a long lasting chance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The constellations are the real knowledge,<br>it is about connecting ideas, not some brand name college.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real education that comes from the heart,<br>will always help students create their best art.</div>
