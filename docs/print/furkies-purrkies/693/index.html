      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Creating And Selling Companies</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a huge problem in product creation:<br>a lot of products come with expiration dates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we are not talking about fruit here,<br>but some of the biggest product ideas that exist today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Apps for phones, Themes for websites, even Electron Desktop programs,<br>need constant support.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This may seem obvious and until you compare these support needs,<br>with a finer category of products, let us call them Static Products.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite example of a product is a seemingly trivial series of backgrounds,<br>imagine something made of of blurry circles that borrows from colors of steel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine offering that re-sized, cropped, and masked (to allow for transparency) for all the common resolutions,<br>from Apple Icons, 1024x768 Desktop Size, to 1080p, 4K, and 8K.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is something you put in a zip file,<br>upload to Creative Market and never have to maintain, debug, upgrade, patch, secure, or refactor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a product that never expires,<br>that never becomes incompatible or old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The effort that goes into maintenance of applications and less static products is so massive,<br>that at the end of the day, it may seem like making a little bit less money would be, better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Companies obviously want to maximize profits,<br>they will jump at the most complex that sells a the highest prices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the truth is that both simple products and complex can make big money,<br>but the simple products will only ever present simple problems, and that is a magnificent power.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I propose that rather than you making complex products,<br>you automatically generate simple ones with custom software that you never put on the market.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then once everything blooms, and you have a hundred products that look OK,<br>you then turn around and sell your company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the first thing you are going to tell you potential buyers,<br>is that your company sells simple products, that require no maintenance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A person who wants to purchase a company,<br>does not want to support all the copies of the product, they just want to sell sell sell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This custom program that greatly helps with static and non-complex product generation,<br>isn't ever sold to a customer that will open a dispute or cause a charge back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an internal company program,<br>guts of which can be insecure, because it just creates products and never touches the internet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No potential buyer of your company will be worried about it,<br>they will be extremely curious, but it will also be well in their powers to pay someone to add or tweak, or fix a feature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will be seen as a factory asset, a good thing,<br>even if it is somewhat quirky.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't want to be too technical here, but if this program ever does have unusual requirements,<br>just put it in a virtual machine where its run environment never changes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can then expose a port to connect to over the network,<br>and you have a web user interface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means the program is setup once, and never needs to be re-installed,<br>it just runs on that machine, is any dependency does change, the virtual machine can be reverted back to an earlier state.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">App publishers can't do this, they are forced to upgrade frameworks, rebuild applications,<br>release new builds, and continuously monitor for bugs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now let us expand on this Desktop Background idea and move into A4 backgrounds for brochures,<br>blanket designs for actual blankets, and even high resolution car wraps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let us upgrade the graphics generator to involve humans,<br>while it is great to have your product generated purely by a machine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you see that you are making a bit of money,<br>why not use some of that money to employ an internet artist to make a unique design for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How about a Horse, it will look great on a Blanket, Car Wrap, Desktop Background,<br>and even a T-Shirt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I believe that good companies are built with zero down - no upfront costs,<br>this idea has been a fine and fair teacher to me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I am certain that a lot of people will dislike the idea of Automatic Generative Graphics,<br>custom magical programs and virtual machines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may actually be better that way,<br>all we need to create a product is a unique image and <span>there are many marketplaces where one can request a quote from<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is probably best to contact local artists,<br>and even better to learn to use <span>GIMP<sup>[2]</sup></span> and create your own Abstract Graphics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In my mind, at first,<br>it is very important that you learn how to use GIMP, as this will help you invent even more products.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Background Images are my favorite example,<br>as I have made over $100 dollars selling just simple backgrounds alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An honest hundred bucks is a big deal,<br>because you then have a real company that you can sell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please take a look at <span>#BuildSell30<sup>[3]</sup></span> a community of business builders,<br>that spend 30 days creating tiny companies and then hope to sell them on <span>MicroAcquire<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should treat this as an exercise to invent more powerful ideas,<br>build ever larger companies, and learn more and more about outstanding Open Source programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While you need to learn to rapidly launch websites,<br>it is not all that good to host your own website at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage you to build up a simple portfolio of products,<br>and maybe custom graphics and publish it on <span>Dribble<sup>[5]</sup></span>, <span>DeviantArt<sup>[6]</sup></span>, or similar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you have 15 - 30 items, apply for a seller account on <span>Creative Market<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>once you reach your first $100 turn right around and search for a buyer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure to create separate email accounts and passwords,<br>so that you can easily hand the little company away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can't sell it, even on e-bay,<br>then expand your online presence with a digital goods store based on existing open source software.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Creative Market setup is a safer idea than self hosting,<br>but some buyers may prefer a self hosted solution, where they can do their own advertising without Creative Market taking a percent of sales.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I will list a few more ideas,<br>as I only used Desktop Backgrounds as a tidy example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than asking someone else to make an image for you, or even making it yourself,<br>get a camera, and go searching for horses you can shoot... Um, with the camera.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you are tasked with becoming a photographer,<br>taking pictures of Cities, Graffiti, Mountains, and Urban Mornings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is by far the best way to establish a fantastic portfolio,<br>you might as well setup an UnSplash account where you give images away for free and sell some as clip-art while at it on a commercial website.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A slightly more invoked source of Graphics, is <span>Krita<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>here you are tasked with becoming a digital painter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage you to <span>take a Hair Painting tutorial in Krita to see how something seemingly impossible, takes but a few minutes to learn<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>so as long as you follow the simple procedure and create a little dark to light palette.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A variation on Desktop Backgrounds and Beyond is Texture Sales,<br>this product is aimed at Designers that are yet to create custom graphics, <span>take a look at Creative Market Graphic Textures for a nice Example<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Textures are also useful for 3D modeling, there are a few more files that you may need to provide,<br>but this can be automated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To learn about Texturing 3D models take a few <span>Texturing Tutorials<sup>[11]</sup></span>,<br>and learn how to use <span>Blender<sup>[12]</sup></span>, it is very natural, and extremely rewarding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially if you get into 3D printing, which I highly recommend,<br>as it will constantly encourage you to learn more and more about 3D modeling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The worlds of 3D modeling and 2D painting are a step towards animation,<br>and that means moving pictures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People make good money from internet videos,<br>and they are often in need of video clip-art such as slow motion or time lapse and maybe even tilt shift videos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Video products are similar to graphics, here you will film falling snow, Urban Sunsets,<br>busy intersections, and sell that as clip-art, that others may include in their title screes or in the background of their credits, or even ads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite spin-off product in this area,<br>is leaving a camera overnight to record full 24 hours of sounds and commotions of summer days in Parks and Forests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>You can offer that as Stress Relief or a Sleep Aid product<sup>[13]</sup></span>,<br>especially great for winter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creating Couch to 5K or 10K workout programs,<br>is yet another idea worth exploring, here you would be building a video fitness company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other side of video is of course audio,<br>and here you have, [lmms], another program you can study - here - to create custom music for your inventions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Simple drum songs go a long way to aid in workouts,<br>and as with everything else you can get local musicians to build up a fetching library of song, that will make your company shine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These are simple products,<br>but their Business Power lies in never requiring maintenance and thus creating a fetching company idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Try to view your companies as an internet bussines person<br>willing to spend a few thousand dollars to Micro Acquire a promising company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will not be interested in purchasing software that needs constant tweaking and security work,<br>but a dozens of high resolution works of art that cover a range of purposes, from phone icons to backgrounds, wall posters, and blankets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...Or time lapse videos of snow piling up, or slow motion birds, or ocean,<br>represent quite a headache free library.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you sell a company,<br>you just make another, start with a simple logo and a short dot-com name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is just great power in simplicity, and we must learn to say no to complexity,<br>the static products will simply not weigh your buyers down with maintenance, bugs, security considerations, and even usage tutorials.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With each product you create, and with each company you sell,<br>you will gain more and more confidence in your abilities, and business experience - eventually you'll make a cool little company that you won't want to sell.</div>
