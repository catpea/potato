      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">We Shall Wonder At: The Future Of Human Kind</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Growing up is important for Humanity as well,<br>right now poverty prevents people from caring about Earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All people of Earth are a single family,<br>and we all have a single aim, Wisdom onward to Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no disagreement about what is wise and what is not,<br>wisdom is a universal thing - it does not create borders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must converge on wisdom,<br>to find Peace, but also energy that will help us look around and see far into the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to ask if the systems that humanity invented,<br>are helping or hurting us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wold Poverty is hurting us,<br>and to fix it, all people of earth need a special credit card.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An Inalienable Human Right,<br>no one will ever go hungry, or homeless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our tolerance of ineffective education,<br>shows that the world is standing still.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The credit card will not track debt,<br>and only feature a daily spending limit to prevent run-away anomalies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The card is the result of asking,<br>if poverty is helping or hurting us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The card is also a reminder that Humanity must advance,<br>we can't just stop at mutually assured destruction, pointless wars, and mass surveillance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no progress to be made here,<br>poverty is an error that will manufacture the need for weapons of mass destruction, endless conflicts, and the kinds of people that need to be monitored.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like a city can't put it's poor out on the street,<br>and then start filling up prisons when they loos their minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must stop creating artificial problems for it self,<br>it has to begin looking at Earth - that is our only real home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If poverty is hurting Humanity,<br>and not only preventing it from seeing the consequences of its own actions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also creates many problems that would be prevented,<br>had it advanced far enough to end poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then our biggest problem that requires immediate attention,<br>is the creation of a wold bank that has a card for all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Money is just an invention,<br>all we need to do is add that extra component to it, a credit card with a reasonable spending limit for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even teachers can't teach,<br>when they need to focus all their attention on putting food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing works, the way it should,<br>because there is no time to consider the world, when we are each a few days away from crisis.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What needs to be made clear,<br>is that this is not some Utopian idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This isn't just meant to help us,<br>this is meant to push the world into Wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is meant to give Humanity time,<br>to look at it self, to look at where it is going, and identify the wisest path ahead - and advance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Too many of Humanity's mistakes are being repeated all around the world,<br>we are one family, it matters what all the people of the world face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't hope for nations to come to an agreement,<br>but we can build a bank that will give the people a new credit card, that never expires, that never runs out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must grow,<br>we have to outgrow the blind repetitions of our mistakes, we have to learn to think about the future generations and their world, and their well being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are our family,<br>and we muse search for ways to help them, eliminating world poverty should be our primary concern.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will help people to books, it will help teachers to teach,<br>it will help us to see, to see that we are one family, and that borders are a silly invention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember that one of Humanity's greatest treasures,<br>is the realization that we are all born equal, and that we have a right to Liberty, and Happiness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Poverty,<br>is the opposite of that, it is about inequality, wage slavery, and it takes away from happiness - and certainly the happiness of the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Here is a more modern version.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Human Beings are equal,<br>that they are endowed unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Freedom, and Happiness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Life, filled with Knowledge, that ignites Wisdom, that Fuels Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Freedom, from man made problems, like Poverty, Uneducation, War, and Weapons of Mass Destruction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Happiness, that is rooted in Authentic Achievement, Real Education, Brilliant Content Of Character,<br>and knowing that one's Contributions create a lasting an meaningful difference both in in life, and as a treasured legacy and a source of wisdom for generations to come.</div>
