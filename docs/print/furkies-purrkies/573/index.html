      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Computers And Color Theory, A Little Programming Tutorial</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My first thought this morning was:<br>explain how programmers make colors with numbers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But then, when I woke up a little bit more,<br>and I though the idea was ridiculous because it is too abstract to explain in text.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I finally got out of bed,<br>I snapped my fingers and said: “Challenge Accepted”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time I returned from the gym,<br>I was grumbling that this is not going to work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here it is, if you visit <span>https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/<sup>[1]</sup></span><br>and click on triad-theory you will see a very simple piece of art in 50 lines of code.<br>(you may need to temporary enable third party cookies on p5js)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Computers have different function or mini-programs that can be used to invent a color,<br>but we want to focus on just one the <span>HSL<sup>[2]</sup></span>, or Hue, Saturation, Luminosity (sometimes called lightness or brightness).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hue, comes from physics,<br>you see it in a prism, our eyes pick up colors between red and violet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Saturation is how much of the color there is,<br>and luminosity is the brightness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what the HSL algorithm aims for,<br>and there is not much more to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to use the H, S and L,<br>is when you already picked a color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you have a red that is too overwhelming,<br>you lower the saturation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If it is too dark, and you need it to stand out more,<br>you increase the luminosity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just to give you an idea, the most popular function is <span>RGB<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>where you mix red, green and blue, web developers tend to use that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">HSL, is better for artists,<br>because an artist may wish to stay within luminosity of 80.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And RGB was not made to use a concept as fancy as luminosity,<br>meaning switching from green to red, will not preserve luminosity at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is another color function worth mentioning and it is <span>CMYK<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>but this function is made for printing, for companies that actually have Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black ink, in stock, for printing on fabric or paper.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of generative art,<br>RGB is a horrible mistake, and HSL gives you colors that hardly ever disappoint, as you can easily reason about brightness and saturation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is more,<br>because while you reason about brightness and saturation in terms of percents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hue, is round, it is a cylinder,<br>from 0 to 360 degrees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is another reason why RGB is a bad choice for computer art,<br>that function doesn’t do circles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Circles are extremely important for art,<br>in color theory colors that oppose on a circle go well together, but the same goes for a triad (three colors), and a tetrad (four colors), and five colors, and probably six, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you have a cylinder of colors,<br>and you are looking for a complimentary color, or the opposite color... you just add 180 to get it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a triad, your starting color is the first color,<br>add 120 to get the second, and 240, to get the third one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For four colors that go well together,<br>you just go around the cylinder in 90 degree increments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the little program I created,<br>I first select a random number between 0 and 360, and that is my main color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I add 120, and 240,<br>to get the full triad of colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then I create three rectangles to fill the screen,<br>I add two randomly positioned semi-transparent circles, a big one and a small one, that feature the first and second color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I created the space between shapes,<br>by giving them very thick outlines, this is a neat shortcut, not really what outlines are intended for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did not want to use functions or loops,<br>to keep the program simple, to help with learning programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each time the play button is clicked,<br>a new triad is chosen, and the circles change position.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right clicking on the art,<br>allows for saving it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I created the screenWidth and screenHeight variables to allow changing the resolution of the generated image, so it is possible to create a desktop background or even something that can be printed out as a poster.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I consider this to be an example of how to teach addition, subtraction, division and degrees,<br>at the end of the class students would be able to parade some fancy infinite artwork.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is possible to sell such little creations,<br>something like this makes a perfect background for a poster, and saves someone five minutes of work - it would probably sell twice a year for a dollar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I was creating this arrangement, I was imagining five or ten paintings,<br>on the otherwise empty walls of a gallery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At which point, one could have an noteworthy photo-shoot for an art or design portfolio,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, color theory is very simple,<br>and computers do all the calculations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As always, the infinite canvas of Generative Art,<br>serve as a fun invitation to learn computer programming, and fill a gallery.</div>
