    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is about,<br>entering the class of learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Documentaries are great,<br>so as long as they are built on facts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Worlds most beloved books,<br>are better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As they are loved,<br>for their wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Narrated Books are probably better,<br>and you can’t go wrong with;</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A Short History Of Nearly Everything<sup>[1]</sup></span> by Bill Bryson,<br>and <span>Death By Black Hole<sup>[2]</sup></span> by Neil DeGrasse Tyson.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Demon Haunted World<sup>[3]</sup></span> by Car Sagan,<br>and <span>The Story Of Philosophy<sup>[4]</sup></span> by Will Durant are also nice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with everything,<br>people will come to tell you Science Popularizers can’t teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you can’t get an education,<br>out of a fun book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They’ll hold up math as proof,<br>thinking it will stick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they don’t know math,<br>and those who do, know the most boring side of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To know mathematics,<br>means to synthesize new ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even, if those ideas were had before,<br>synthesis will eventually take you out into Terra Incognita.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get started with that,<br>begin building a universe with <span>P5.js<sup>[5]</sup></span> and <span>Math As Code<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t have to build a simulation, create pixel art games,<br>build a game around concepts in Physics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Warping space to move faster than light, traveling at near light speed,<br>superluminal motion and relativity, paradoxes in physics, and even listing to radio signals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to get into the zone,<br>just start by making platformed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can see, without me trying to convince you,<br>how fun, mysterious, and fascinating math is when you learn for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But before all this, get mad or at least become suspicions,<br>about people with all the answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because being given all the answers without thinking or effort,<br>is often an attack with the aim of preventing you from asking real questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you don’t ask questions, and when you don’t question results,<br>you become a tool to make other people’s creepy lives easier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, don’t just start by just listening to a neat book,<br>start by buying a backpack, and slowly fill it with neat and mysterious camping things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t have to go far.<br>Setting up camp and spending a day taking pictures at a local State Park...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While listening to your favorite books;<br>is perfect - so as long as you bring some fruit and have a picnic too.</div>
