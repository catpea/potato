      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Do Not Give Up Your Creativity At Any Cost</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me show you a couple of strange ways,<br>with which creativity and thus mental health can be upset.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One describes strangeness or elitism as the case may be, in art community,<br>where young people are pushed away from joining, by being forced into pointless tricks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the other is a broader example from the programmer community,<br><span>where a programmer just asked about burnout and loss of creativity<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The point of this text is to remind all that,<br>that our minds need room to grow and keep healthy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while poverty is terrifying and deadly, is is a mistake,<br>that humanity will eventually repair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get to that point,<br>we must allow our creativity to flourish.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The hateful artists will say,<br>you can’t use a reference image directly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are doing this,<br>to elevate themselves above you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please don’t actually do what I am about to describe,<br>that is just a dumb waste of time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take your source image, a portrait for example,<br>cover it with a transparency or a see through bag.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a dry erase marker,<br>and connect the eyes to the tip of the nose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, look at the triangle you just made,<br>study it, and very gently with a pencil at first, put it on your canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now connect something on the face to the ears<br>just pick something, and copy that shape too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now the two shapes on the canvas,<br>mark all the important points on the face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now connect the dots,<br>and congratulations...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just wasted three minutes,<br>on not just putting an x where the eyes are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, I had you do this awful thing,<br>to show you how other artists, all those really nice people, PUSH YOU AROUND.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">DO NOT, let them poison art,<br><span>use your reference images directly<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if anybody challenges you,<br>you tell them that slightly crooked portraits with misshapen features are not art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you finish your painting,<br>you grab everyone near you by their ears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An you teach them,<br>how to be an artist too - without the stupid shapes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now onto the second,<br>broader example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Think about horses, there are the wild ones out by Rocky Mountains,<br>they are wise, dumb, useless, and probably bite, but they are not warped.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then there are the ones beaten or pressed into submission,<br>they are raced, bread, doped, fed ... stressed out an over medicated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A healthy human being cannot keep focus on a single thing, we are not machines,<br>we are dreamers, explorers, adventures and inventors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When programmers complain about focus and loss of passion for personal projects,<br>is a sign of health, of his system resisting becoming broken in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He is still in part a wild horse,<br>and the truth is, once he is broken in - he will never have passion to invent again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not without medication, for a cultural disorder,<br>in a culture that calls for workers to work all their lives...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failing that,<br>marks them as having a deficit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds cannot do just one thing over and over,<br>we need to switch subjects, curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Vacation is an example of switching,<br>look how your health returns.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Getting a writers block,<br>is an example of the opposite.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of having focused on a singe task so long,<br>that the task is depleted of the fizz that comes with approaching a subject that calls to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My goodness, every person in the word,<br>will always tell a person like that, to take a break, to do something else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yet we don’t apply the same to ourselves,<br>we instead walk into a doctor’s office and tell them we can’t focus.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, he’ll give you medication all right,<br>but at the cost of your creativity for everything else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will medicate your natural predispositions away,<br>and chemically break yourself in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just wait until it comes out that <span>schools have been purposefully over medicating<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>tolerating student drug use to increase school’s collective GPA<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And psychologists tolerated it because they defined the disorder,<br>not relative to a healthy mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But relative to the majority of modern culture,<br>it became a disorder, because everyone is overworked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is more to it, Humanity does not have to be chained by poverty,<br>there is a better way to use the concept of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But to get there, majority must recognize adventure, creativity and ahealthy mind,<br>as something that must be protected, not medicated away, to become a convenient employee.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Afterword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am not familiar with the Attention Deficit Disorder, I do believe that it is a real condition, and that there is medicine that helps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But like Sir Ken Robinson,<br>I suspect, that there is also a fictitious epidemic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me put it this way, if corporations are ever allowed,<br>to prescribe their employees anti-depressants that improve productivity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if schools are ever allowed to prescribe their students medication,<br>that temporary enhanced their focus and retention... long therm be damned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will do it, it maybe hard for you to believe,<br>so let me put it this way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Schools will sell out their students for anything involving money<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>by providing them with a mix of facts that they can temporary memorize pass state tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And corporations will maximize profits,<br>at the cost of the well being of their employees.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I do not have proof for any of this,<br>but <span>I am certain that Authentic Self Education, is far more powerful, than standardized education<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
