    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When drawing on the computer,<br>or tracing a real pencil sketch...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use a very thin brush,<br>as think as you can go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because when coloring a circle for example,<br>you simply use the contiguous selection tool...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a grow setting,<br>so that the selection that is created on the inside...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cuts into your line art,<br>as a result becomes tucked beneath the line art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you have an intricate design,<br>like eyes on a face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no good reason why there should be a large gap,<br>when you turn off you line art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The color of the eyeball and the color of the face,<br>should almost touch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should be able to tun off the lines in your illustration,<br>and not see holes where the lines were.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose to make your illustration more realistic,<br>by removing the lines and extending the gradients.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You won't have to go around all the edges,<br>filling in the holes left by lines that you have now removed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Using a selection tool to select an area defined by your drawing,<br>and then filling it with color is not the perfect approach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But gosh darn it is is fast,<br>it is almost powerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is perfect,<br>if you are just doing illustrations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another alternative is,<br>is not to use the selection tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just use a standard brush,<br>and paint over your line art like a normal person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This does not mean you are eliminating your line art,<br>because once you are done painting...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can move the line art layer above it.<br>there are no holes here, no problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You end up with an illustration that can have strong outlines,<br>or no lines at all, just gradients you painted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the problem here is that you have to be careful not to go over the line,<br>which is what the contiguous selection tool can help you with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best approach,<br>is a fusion of both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use the contiguous selection tool, along with grow selection under Select menu,<br>and paint over you line art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So here the selection tool,<br>allows you not to worry about going over the line...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And manually growing it will help you stack your layers,<br>without any holes, and in a way that is compatible with your line art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that you can bring it back,<br>above your painting, if you wish.</div>
