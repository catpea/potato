  <div class="paragraph">I am starting to think that Superhero belts,<br>are not as silly as they sound.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>One seller on etsy made $657,900 dollars selling the Batman Begins / Dark Knight Utility Belt<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>which is for costumes only.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My own design,<br>an extension of the wallet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will be able to hold credit-cards,<br>phones, car remote, music player, and more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not to mention the massive test of courage,<br>that walking around with what looks like a bat-belt represents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what an adventure,<br>that could be?</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When was the list time someone asked you,<br>if those are real smoke bombs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when was the last time that you actually went to the dollar store,<br>to pick up a couple of them?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Specifically,<br>because not only does your belt support them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in deed actively encourages you to get some,<br>as it has a cute little compartment for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who cares that come July 4th,<br>unlike Batman you need to fiddle with a lighter to light them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then they puff a baby-cloud of indeterminate color that even a ninja couldn't hide in,<br>a smoke bomb is a smoke bomb.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course,<br>the little pocket doubles as a convenient neat little hiding place for candy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It supports anything between four Tootsie Rolls,<br>to a couple of Ferrero Rocher - with crunchy hazelnuts.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Seriously though,<br>it is all only as foolish as you want it to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People looking at your portfolio won't care if it is a superhero belt or a Raspberry Pi computer-case,<br>as this is a question of your creativity and accomplishment.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">(It is a very noble thing to set off to get a PhD,<br>to further science, to make a difference for people that need help and support in a hospital.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is an easy way,<br>and a hard way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The easy way, is what the etsy seller is doing,<br>by the amount of money they made, they removed their stress of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are taking advantage of students by forcing them into debt,<br>we must encourage students to create, to learn independently alongside all the broken lectures and promises.)</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Even before finishing this text,<br>I already started testing Tactical Jewelry design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am not yet quite sure what that is,<br>but I bet it is great for a portfolio and self defense, and certainly fascinating to look at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wow that is a very interesting bracelet you go there mam",<br>"it is actually all the components I need to swiftly assemble a dependable grappling hook - merely arranged to look like a fancy bracelet"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I often use it to escape boring conversations, and inquisitive people, like you,"</div>
