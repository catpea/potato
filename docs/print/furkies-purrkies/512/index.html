    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I really like how my portable Linux based player,<br>has neither a screen not keyboard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just this one chain,<br>Battery, Linux, Audio Card.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more I though about adding buttons,<br>the more un-pure my invention had seemed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This Is A Digital Audio Player,<br>it is meant to be raw, and clean.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So the keyboard and screen is a no go,<br>which brings us to the original problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How do I start, stop, previous, next,<br>and manipulate the volume.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bluetooth Shutter!<br>you know how people take photos with a little remote?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yeah, when I bought one for my phone,<br>I discovered it would mess with other apps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><img src="/image/poetry-0512-worstphotoever.jpg" alt="Shutter Outtake" style="width: 50%;"></div>
  <div class="paragraph">I could click send on a text message from,<br>10 meters away, useless but amazing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because that meant, those cheap little remote shutters,<br>simulate standard keyboards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I love little useless facts like that,<br>this particular one came in handy dandy this weekend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I connected it to my Linux based audio player,<br>it took four and a half hours - but I connected it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I witnessed my final version of my MP3 player invention from 1998,<br>the Linux goes into a snazzy jazzy fanny pack, and the Bluetooth remote in my pocket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While the buttons don't stick out enough,<br>I can make my own Bluetooth keyboard device, it is no big deal - I like this little shutter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have to read the raw Linux keyboard input to get at the data,<br>I have a perfectly functional prototype downstairs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it needs to be re-written in node js,<br>as I will add a phone UI, or maybe a hotpot UI that can maybe stream to other phones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Might as well write it all out in Node.js,<br>and maybe Svelte on the Browser end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond simple controls,<br>I'll provide audio feedback when buttons are pushed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A long press on one of the buttons can activate the main menu,<br>where I can jam a bunch of crazy Linux things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This tiny invention isn't just about Audio,<br>it is about the coming of age of portable GNU/Linux Hardware.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a pocket server,<br>it can do anything, including phone calls over the internet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a modular computer device,<br>you can plug anything into it, and expand it $20 at a time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It can play audio, it can compose songs,<br>it can read you audio books, it can play audio books, or help you record them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It can keep you connected to the internet,<br>or it can become the local internet offering whatever it has downloaded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today's phones make a person seem uninterested in real life,<br>connecting these little devices together, however, makes a person seem trendy and clever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us all hope that the cool technology of tomorrow,<br>is wearable computer networks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I hope we can all work together towards making,<br>Bat Belts socially acceptable, and cool.</div>
