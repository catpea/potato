      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Discovery And Practice Of Lowbrow Art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Years ago,<br>in my Art adventures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd put on the classy <span>Coralie Cl√©ment<sup>[1]</sup></span><br>and drive to the Biggest Bookstore I found.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Looking at pencil drawing tutorials,<br>taught me the importance of creating Art Books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And looking thorough reference graphics for designers,<br>was as abstract and random, as fascinating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I thumbed through thick books,<br>filled with stickers, logos, and doodles - it was a amazing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wasn't looking for anything in particular,<br>so I started in the beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Week after week,<br>I'd inspect new art books, sometimes new arrivals even.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And eventually I found a book with Lowbrow art,<br>or Pop Surrealism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This was not a happy moment for me,<br>Pop Surrealism is on another level.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Seeing the beauty of Realism,<br>taken to Cartoons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And actually made better, somehow;<br>was devastating for me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I feel like, <strong>that day</strong>,<br>lowbrow broke my heart in a sweet Surrealist way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I couldn't do anything like it,<br>I couldn't even move oils like that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I certainly have not been ready,<br>to witness anything that beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even hours ago,<br>the eyes I drew on my new Mona, were tiny compared to what I needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this very hour, I discovered that I needed to resize her body,<br>down to almost the size of her fancy head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am still being changed,<br>still being taught this silly magic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I must have laughed four times at Mona's eyes,<br>and took several trips to the computer just to look at the screen again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am laughing right now,<br>that forehead, is so perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I just brightened up her eyes,<br>apparently enough to stare in to people's souls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's art,<br>that's my kind of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Funny,<br>as heck.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">My Grandma had a neat framed copy of <span>Lady with an Ermine<sup>[2]</sup></span> in her living room,<br>the original is in a Polish museum about three hours away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From my youngest age, I used to wonder about it,<br>I never got over how ferocious and muscular that animal is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect that painting is the reason<br>why Squirrels make me so happy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'll try learning with that one,<br>as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With two or three celebrity portraits,<br>and a self-portrait or two, <span>I could open up a little online store and take requests<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where learning to paint does not benefit from tracing,<br>and is best done freehand by only looking at a reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Custom portraits benefit from keeping as close as possible to the original,<br>and that is also more reliable and faster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At $25 or $50 per digital portrait,<br>it is a fun way to build a mighty portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The customer can then request that a local print-shop prints it out on glossy paper,<br>and have it framed - this completely eliminates shipping and workmanship problems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every little hobby,<br>leads to some interesting little way to make a dollar or two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It also opens up the opportunity to create speed painting or time lapse advertising videos,<br>where you could them offer their full versions with a tutorial commentary for a fee.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can also create an art book,<br>that would make someone browsing books at the local bookstore pause.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And beyond that, what sells for $25 dollars, can make $250,<br>if you co-found a small company with other artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A purely digital remote job,<br>where you can even train others how to create the art; and where they in turn, can sharpen their skills.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The point of Art is not money,<br>art is about expanding your creativity with magnificent practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art makes you stronger,<br>and art makes you laugh.</div>
