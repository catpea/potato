      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Human</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world has always been improving,<br>but we had a bad start, we made unforgivable mistakes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Dear and Saintly Sir Ken Robinson,<br>has once reminded us of what Robert Ardrey said:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles,<br>and our irreconcilable regiments?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or our treaties whatever they may be worth;<br>our symphonies however seldom they may be played;<br>our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields;<br>our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses."</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The upcoming change that will take root this,<br>or the next century at the latest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will be about switching perspectives,<br>from "We The People" to "The Human".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This change comes on the shoulders of giants,<br>Medicine, Psychology, and all the other daughters of Philosophy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be a short pause,<br>as we begin asking if the lives that human beings live are worthy of their beauty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Up to that point we will have made laws,<br>without paying enough attention to results, to real results, to meaningful results, to positive and reproducible results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this tipping point,<br>we will look at the results, across the entire spectrum of the Human Kind, and ask: "Are we helping or hurting?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at judges down South that didn't walk out during segregation,<br>we will look at judges that didn't walk out during Mass Incarceration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at police officers indoctrinated into a culture of killing,<br>we will look at corporations that distribute guilt among so many that all seem innocent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at teachers who tolerate bullies,<br>until victims bring kitchen knives to school, and end up being sentenced to life in prison, for a crime, who we are guilt of due to our ignorance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at law men who detain children for so long,<br>that when they lie to them, that all it takes to go home is to confess, they get a confession and the child gets prison, while wealthy evil monsters go free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at military recruitment of children,<br>with the promise of paid-for schools that should be free, and a career so gray, that all there is left is either <span>being immortalized by breathtaking filthy poetry<sup>[1]</sup></span> of going postal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we are done looking at all the stupid results that we created,<br>we will then ask individual Human Beings, about how we can help them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will ask at Beloved Grandmothers, abandoned alone to deadly cancer treatments,<br>and we will ask decades of children who were indoctrinated into cultures of violence and later prison for forgiveness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we will not stop asking,<br>until every culture and every age group, answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until we know for certain,<br>if we are helping us, or if we are hurting us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"We the people" will finally grow up enough to accept the responsibility for their existence,<br>for their decision making, and all the unforgivable mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we will not let the mistakes keep us down,<br>we will not let them propagate into the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no there will not be borders so that evil men can "Fix Economy",<br>by killing off another nation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be The Human,<br>and at each epoch of their existence they will be helped, inspired, loved, and appreciated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teenagers, not going to be brainlessly taught to get wasted and laid,<br>and sent to college towns full of stones and bars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And schools where the model students<br>are the pill poppers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we will no longer harm them,<br>we will help them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them to see mistakes,<br>and help them to healthy and wise futures - that only <em>they</em> can imagine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The twenty somethings will not start their lives with broken hearts,<br>because real life is precious, is either GROW, or just go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will not start their lives in debt,<br>created by predatory organizations from credit card companies to the very schools that they memorize garbage to get into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will start their lives in balance, with <span>start-ups<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>knowing that the old kind of school was a con-game as bad as the many religions that pinch pennies from desperate old ladies.<br>(and hope that nobody remembers the hundreds of years of all the evil things that they got away with).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will grow in wisdom, and in strength,<br>and discover - the light - of each other lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the thirty somethings,<br>they will come to sense what they are truly capable of, how far their steps carry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will look back and see all the mistakes that we have mindlessly propagated for generations,<br>and they will stand guard to ensure, that they are nothing like we were at the turn of the millennium.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the forty somethings an beyond,<br>will stand as Powerful and Fully Matured Human Beings who are no longer passive passengers to be ferried to the next undefined stage, or played like a piano-key.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Powerful Human, the Enabled Human, The Wise Human with an eye on Greatness,<br>will reach heights that were previously undreamed by the best of us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will ensure profound, positive, lasting contribution to Human Kind,<br>and <span>All Life On Earth<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the turn of the millennium,<br>ignorance drove the politicians to use war as means of increasing health of economies - it was their unspoken secret to success.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will never be forgiven by the future generations,<br>and in the first or the second century, as fact finally crushes opinion with anger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Economies will be repaired, by helping The Human... to Mental Health, to Real Education, to Knowledge, to Wisdom,<br>and above all to becoming the Great Beings upon whose shoulders, the future generation can build, to no end in time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until that day comes,<br>the children we'll be watching you.</div>
