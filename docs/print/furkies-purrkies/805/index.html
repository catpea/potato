    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A dream of creating a real open and free World School,<br>that can help humanity converge on functional and powerful wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In centuries past people didn't know to learn,<br>and today we don't know to grow all the way up.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The difference between a cheerful programmer,<br>and a person who does not understand that they are forced to work...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is culture, the family culture, the surrounding culture,<br>they culture they were born into, the culture they are surrounded by.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some may become violent gang members, some soldiers,<br>for some maybe there will be no return, for most there is always a way back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But our best hope is preventing,<br>lies, deception, and the fracturing of minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All young people must be free to safely travel the world,<br>they must see how cultures change from place to place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they must understand, through and through,<br>and deep down within their soul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That we are one family,<br>and above all that we are each a citizen of the world first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone must be aware,<br>how easily misled we are.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some nations purposefully warp people minds,<br>to create workers, soldiers, obedient citizens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Criminals have their minds poisoned,<br>by broken culture, family, fear, or poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Leaders enter into character, like an actor would,<br>as otherwise the other liars will out compete them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the same exact mechanic, over and over,<br>denial of Knowledge, Wisdom, Greatness, and the Advancement of Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Enlighten the world,<br>so that liars have no shadow to hide in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must remind that each is rise to become a Great Being,<br>in Dignity and Authenticity, Knowledge and Wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must, restore Education's aim,<br>and help wiser politicians to represent the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must, end poverty to prevent it from fracturing people<br>into lives of darkness, or crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must, converge on wisdom in a peaceful word,<br>where borders stand as a reminder, not a divider.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let the students take to the wisest books,<br>inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remind those with hard won wisdom to share it,<br>in the books that the students will later read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let each generation refine and improve,<br>on the knowledge and culture they grew up with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let the new generations begin,<br>at the heights their predecessors reached.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Understand that for a nation, to isolate it self,<br>means to poison its people with propaganda.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a sign of injustice,<br>Human Rights violations, slavery, and eventually war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The precursor to propaganda is ineffective education,<br>an imperceptible process to unravel all hope and dream.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In our wisdom we must learn to understand,<br>that we are one family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that we need to share in an authentic and powerful,<br>global educational system.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first lectures by radio but later, like in a modern computer game,<br>a person moves in the direction they choose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here they won't be able to progress beyond certain points,<br>until they have the necessary skill and knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now is the time to make use of inexpensive radio, and small portable commuters,<br>to help us all understand that we are one family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that we are all,<br>meant to converge on wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That our aim should be nothing short of,<br>reason, reality, knowledge, wisdom, greatness and World Peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wold will neither grow. nor get any better,<br>until all understand that we each, must, aim; to become a Great Being.</div>
