  <div class="paragraph">We know schools are such an important thing,<br>that every child in the world goes to school - just like that.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We correctly see schools as part of growing up,<br>we see denying schools as a horrible crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our vision falters beyond that point,<br>because we don't quite yet know what effective education is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>We have some really, really good ideas about real schools<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>but we are far from creating real good ones<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are close, we are really are,<br>we just now identified that we can't have grades, and that we probably can't have subject divisions.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We needed the emergence of real schools somewhere in the 50's or 90's,<br>we really messed up, though it is just now that we started carrying computers in our pockets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just now, that we are beginning to see,<br>that school starts on a little screen, and is driven by the student's own curiosity, not a mangled curriculum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is their amazing creations will create a passion for subjects that seem awful at first,<br>the students best learn in context of their curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we are just now learning that real education is not just about knowledge,<br>learning for real ignites creativity, empowers wisdom, and drives students towards Greatness.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A lot of mistakes can be prevented by making schools more powerful,<br><span>by not pretending that what we have today, works<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All school graduates when looking back at their experience,<br>can easily see how ineffective their education was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all know, and we do nothing to fix it,<br><span>we push students into memorization at the cost of their creativity<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is such an urgent issue,<br>that we should ask all the world's students to stop memorizing for tests, and demand effective education.</div>
</div>

  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to help them to reject the easily corruptible the grade system,<br>and push the teachers into guiding them into an integrated self-directed education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must explain to all the world's students that real education,<br>is a door to creativity, wisdom and greatness - the very thing that their mind and future depends on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we ourselves must understand,<br>that our wars must not be fought by our children.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our greatest invention is not technology, or schools and books,<br>it is our culture of world peace, creativity and education, wisdom and achievement, leadership and unity, advancement and greatness.</div>
