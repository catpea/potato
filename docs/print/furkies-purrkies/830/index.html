      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Unlocking The Future Of The World; Or, Stalemate Prevention</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though the younger matter the most, it all matters, because we are one family,<br>but we are also using tools that are cutting us off from making the future a happy and safe place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of the troubles that we can’t solve,<br>we can’t solve because they arrived at a locked state, or a stalemate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are the often tragic outcomes,<br>of having spent years of decades doing nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The situation reduced it self,<br>to a state that has no solution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some politicians call that a triumph,<br>where it comes to mutually assured destruction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is not a triumph,<br>it is things at an end, a tragedy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others are pretending problems do not exist,<br>for example, a lot of violent criminals suffer from lead poisoning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a major part due to use of leaded gasoline,<br>and leaded paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need medical help,<br>not anymore punishment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are solutions,<br>and I think all of them require education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To prevent two nations from destroying each other,<br>you help their leaders think themselves out of their dead ends, and thus resign.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who acted due to poison in their system,<br>they need to be out of cages, and they need therapy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We as the Great Human Family,<br>have only one guaranteed way to fix problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that way requires thinking ahead,<br>and preventing them from occurring in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we do nothing,<br>if we just let the world drift.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And merely keep en eye on micro plastics in our blood,<br>whit counting how many species we lost, or how many soldiers died in the world’s battlefields.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then we will surely and swiftly arrive at stalemates,<br>situations without solutions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some stalemates are particularly hard to spot,<br>such as the state of education today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reason it is so hard to learn math,<br>is that there is not such thing as just math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The very subject divisions in schools, prevent learning<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>not to mention grades which prevent thieving else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once applied the mathematics we learn in school,<br>are so tiny and trivial that it is nearly impossible to hand the same of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it as a student, or a teacher,<br>a philosopher, or a 3D modeler.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here is the cradle,<br>the root of it all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Middle School,<br>the place where the last few lessons are had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before teachers start pretending to teach,<br>and students - under the threat of never getting a job - start pretending to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a tiny step here, become a bully, get drafted,<br>and realize you just became a slave to a stupid war driven by a dictator animated by drugs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, all of this, this has to be prevented,<br>by doing nothing to prevent problems, the problems, become unfixable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow to become a great being,<br>please, please, do not ask "what would I do to solve this or that world problem?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But instead Ask, the correct question,<br>"What would I do, to prevent those problems, from occurring in the first place."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The one lesson none of the members of our Great Human Family can ever forget,<br>is that, to grow up means to grow all the way up.</div>
