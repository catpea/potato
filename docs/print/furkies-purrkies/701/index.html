      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom: Our Most Natural And Greatest Superpower</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The name of species is crowned with the word:<br>wise, as in Wise Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom separates us,<br>from all the other animals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom we are almost lost,<br>we are forced into confusion, and reliance of most basic skills.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Throughout history, it was well known,<br>that to control people, one merely needs to deny them wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the reason for book burning,<br>this is the reason for <span>laws meant to prevent education<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the reason,<br>why many religions replace knowledge with fantasy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge and resulting wisdom,<br>are as important to us as Oxygen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is the reason,<br>why many gave up their lives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the truth behind the story of Socrates,<br>without wisdom a life is not worth living.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of wisdom will corrupt our greatest works,<br>along with the <span>Police<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>Judgges<sup>[3]</sup></span>, and <span>Politicians<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to undo corruption, in a way that makes liars fail,<br>is by emphasizing the importance of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by making schools effectively ignite it,<br>in the students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a way of solving problems before they happen,<br>and it is called prevention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom does not require schools,<br>it is just that schools can bring it to students as early as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today <span>schools are corrupt and malformed as well<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>but like with every thing else this is a matter of prevention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This means that before we can fix schools,<br>we have to emphasize self education that leads to wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all know schools as a rough or toxic place,<br>but real education pleasant, beautiful, happy and full of adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In this amazing age, we can <span>borrow narrated books<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>or <span>download the classics for free<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very important to understand that listening and learning from great books,<br>is more important than pretending to pass tests by cramming in ineffective schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to learn, has the same effect as being denied an education,<br>pretending is the reason why our greatest inventions are corrupt today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the force of wisdom is removed from us,<br>we lose most of our abilities to comprehend, create, extend, and build.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In out confusion,<br>we will blindly undo the work of the great beings that came before us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will be forced to pretend, perform, and lie,<br>and thus become a force of corruption.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, in our collective wisdom,<br>we have named our species Wise Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most importantly know that wisdom is what we are good at,<br>not only do we greatly overestimate out distance to it, but we already have some within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a perfect road to wisdom,<br>that fills in all the blanks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A road that in no time,<br>restores our health, and sets all the things and priorities right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is ancient,<br>it is the same road we have always traveled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though today we get to take the World's Wisdom with us,<br>and listen to great many Narrated Books with each of our journeys.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Take to the ancient tradition of hiking the nature trails<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br><span>let them teach and restore you<sup>[9]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is not something that you will discover in your memory or journals,<br>it is a new flame that is kindled within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an ever rising power of creativity, insight,<br>unbreakability, dignity, foresight, and courage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once ignited, the flame can only spread and burn ever brighter,<br>it creates a force of prevention, a force that no liar nor corruption, will ever see coming.</div>
