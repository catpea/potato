    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no such thing as preparations for adventure,<br>because adventure is not something external.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not packed already,<br>always ready as a matter of daily routine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then all you need to pack,<br>is all the curiosities already in your purse and whatever you have in your pockets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not true that adventure requires driving,<br>but if that is what the heart wishes for, then allow me to explain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Adventurers like simple roads,<br>highway by highway they take them to the end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually the highways end,<br>and there is always a town.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you guessed it, it is full of strange creatures,<br>and often refereed to as the end of the road town.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In my case it was Florida Keys,<br>75 South and then US-1, it always takes a few days.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the first few adventure are the longest,<br>later you only do the things you like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I took to bicycling, never too far, and not always,<br>just on interesting days when there is nothing going on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My bicycle is always ready,<br>always waiting by the door, I don't even put it in the garage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just grab a bottle of water,<br>and skatoosh.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I go as far as the nearest interesting thing,<br>and as slow, as one could possibly go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My adventure path runs by a noisy highway,<br>but I just grab a pair of ear plugs, no problemo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bought a proper mudguard fender this year,<br>so I like to investigate the trails after it rains in some unusual way, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is really important to take photos,<br>as many as you can snap, will do; you can sort them out later, and make a safe backup.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All adventures need something to ponder about,<br>for example I am just about to go on a tiny, bicycle adventure myself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I set the aim,<br>to be about helping people structure poetry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I already have something extremely important to share,<br>all interesting poems need an equally interesting package.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I actually became aware of this as a little boy watching Indiana Jones movies,<br>the way the whole move seemed to change when he flew across an ocean is what made those movies so interesting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we are talking about adventure,<br>we are using the adventure to teach about poetry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not all people are interested in tiny adventures,<br>likewise not all people are interested in little poems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, I think most people will find something curious,<br>as we move from one to the other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Proper poetry wants you to pay attention to the rhythm of your words,<br>and ensure that the rhymes come in predictable places, this is very similar to music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this adventure poetry tutorial, I will show you how to write less strict, a more open type of rhyme,<br>this flexibility will allow the message behind your poem to stay clear, and mostly understandable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you have never used a <span>rhyming dictionary<sup>[1]</sup></span> before,<br>you can just search the web for it, and use an on-line one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we are going to write two lines of text, the first one can be long-ish and must end with a word that has rhymes,<br>and the second one should be shorter as to quickly end with the rhyming word.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you read them, and I think all poems should be recorded as audio by their authors,<br>try to somewhat speed through the second line to get to the rhyming word as quickly as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A neat and tidy poem should have between nine and twelve, maybe sixteen such creations,<br>but it is up to you, it depends on how much you have to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, first line can be long, that where you say something meaningful,<br>but end it with a word that has rhymes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To write the second shorter line, you have to go through the words that rhyme with the last word in the long line,<br>and add a short relevant sub-statement that strengthens your first line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes you may need to change the first line to end on a better word,<br>to make the second line easier to write, oh, and short and simple words are usually the ones that have nicest rhymes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me show you a simple example poem,<br>that uses this approach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As bicycling goes, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny,<br>even if the clouds look a little funny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But yes it will probably rain a little bit,<br>but it is still worth it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For one it makes for an amazing bicycle-selfie photo op,<br>and you don't even have to stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you get home you can show everyone what a mighty adventurer you are,<br>and become a superstar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So here I stretched my own rule and used only four stanzas,<br>just to keep it simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each line took about two tries to get it right,<br>I really wanted to rhyme sunny with bunny, but it made the line way too long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can think of that as an invitation to the second part of the poem,<br>where you talk about the friends you made along the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I saw a frog or an otter, <span>angry birds that were just about to swoop down to peck me<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and about five maybe seven bunnies, including a really tiny one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I want to underscore,<br>how important it is to wrap your poem in another poem, or story to make it more interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And bring to your attention that this poem was so sweet an simple,<br>because I lived it, I was there, my shirt got wet, I talked at the bunnies to keep them from being scared...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I even ended up with rain, on the inside of my bug eye-protection glasses,<br>I had to stop to wipe it off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A colorful poem is easiest to write,<br>when you were actually there, in the middle of the story.</div>
