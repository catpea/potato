  <div class="paragraph">I have made one mistake in Art when I begun,<br>I didn't know to start writing an art book, and get it done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is an idea that I would like to share with you,<br>and I hope that you will share too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, it maybe that your biggest work of art,<br>is a book that will help others start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Guess who is going to do all the illustrations?<br>yes, <strong>you</strong>, congratulations!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a three part project,<br>so make sure all the items are checked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One, write down the advice that comes to you while you draw,<br>even if it seems clumsy or raw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Two, illustrate pencils, screen projectors, and computer programs you use,<br>you can draw some helpful diagrams, if you choose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Three, your book also keeps photos of all your works,<br>that's one of the neat perks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But go slow as most new artists can't buy too much,<br>so start with a simple and small drawing kit, graphite paper, and such.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And always remind your students to get the shadows right,<br>make sure the light in their source photos is very bright.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is always good to start with hard light; and deep shadows and darks,<br>as those become the works that will get the most remarks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Good light and some hard shadows will make a portrait come alive,<br>and your book project will thrive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Always have copies of your book to give away for free,<br>and remind the new artists not to go on a shopping spree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Artist's pencils should be inexpensive and easy to get,<br>then all they need is some paper and blending stumps, and they are set.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remind your students not to push the pencils into paper too much,<br>tell them not to scar their paper, and to keep a light touch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To be respectful of the person you are drawing you can't be too-careful,<br>use a projector of graphite copy paper to make your subject cheerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should take the photo yourself, print it out and trace it,<br>this can only server to your benefit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you like computers load it up into a photo editing app,<br>lower color count and trace edges to create a tracing map.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't mind electronics get a pico or mini projector,<br>or you can get a inexpensive one that uses a light bulb and a reflector.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you trace all the proportions right,<br>that's when you really start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I always begun with the eyes,<br>I made them wise and full of stars and skies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Always create multiple sketches, portraits, and works,<br>some with deep darks overwhelmed with shadows, others full of fireworks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to just create one work of art,<br>it will either be too much light or too dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes many tries to frame a person's character, heart, soul,<br>and that should always be the goal.</div>
