      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Towards The Future Of Human Kind</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see what broken schools do,<br>they close the minds of men.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So tightly, that their world is a world of fantasy,<br>the language they speak is pictorial.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It contains words born of TV,<br>snippets of scenes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are easily threatened,<br>and they can easily let go of thought, in favor of nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was supposed to be the last war,<br>because no one could possibly be as cruel again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the switched-off mind,<br>knows no feeling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This world does not belong to leaders,<br>it belongs to the children of the people that employ them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It belongs to the future generations,<br>not any particular chain link.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If we can't switch to decision making across generations,<br>for all the energetic leaders and speeches...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity will go in a circle,<br>and end up where it begun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Problems,<br>must prevented decades ahead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Misinformation is just the more vile part of the problem,<br>as it is rooted in un-education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tolerance of ineffective schools,<br>shows we are tolerating the things that fuel misled minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The problem is two fold,<br>poverty and un-education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a series of events that could end global poverty,<br>and there is a series of events that could end lack of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But unless they run intertwined, multiplexed,<br>at the same time, solving their own host of problems - the repairs we need may fail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The global elimination of poverty,<br>and creation of relevant personalized education with the direct aim of advancement of human kind...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Requires deliberate, long term effort,<br>and wise planning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The politicians have cornered themselves,<br>they will reject end of poverty, or making schools more realistic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many will laugh at the idea,<br>they will never connect that poverty and un-education is where war starts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The leaders can't think of prevention,<br>everything they know tolerates poverty, tolerates a low level of education, and tolerates dead ends.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Like water is wet and sky is blue,<br>poverty is not for me, but it is for you."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the people in the streets of the poorest countries,<br>must be helped towards real education and certainty that poverty is over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If we ignore poverty a world away,<br>we are just creating another conflict for two generations ahead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what those ideas,<br>sound like today:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There is something far worse than World War Three,<br>and that is World War Four."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The Global Universal Income Card,<br>is for all including criminals."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Fine Narrated Books written by great beings,<br>especially for the so called beggar in the street."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In order to comprehend their relevance and importance,<br>and appreciate prevention, and how ending poverty and lack of education ends all wars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need a new generation of leaders,<br>we have to help the students of today understand that the aim is Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the meaning of growing up, of growing all the way up,<br>is becoming a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take a generation of great beings,<br>a cultural revolution towards greatness of mind and heart...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To face the mistakes that we are repeating,<br>in all our weakness and smallness...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And repair it all, and in the process preventing suffering and war,<br>by means of a global end to poverty, and an end of impersonal and ineffective education.</div>
