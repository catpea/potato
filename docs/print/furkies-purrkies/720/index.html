      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Talent Integration: The Online Academy Of Art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you see that Artistic Realism is within reach,<br>that it is a system of things not a talent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can get together with your schoolmates,<br>and begin building an Art Academy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful not to charge students up-front tuition,<br>a real school teaches for free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like a business investor,<br>take a percentage from student's art sales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suggest you ask the student to decide,<br>how much of a cut you should get, allow yearly adjustments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A painting that comes to life,<br>will keep a museum alive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Supports galleries,<br>and all the artistic things that connect to it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art Supports artists,<br>even the famous ones will come to your online classes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Building the Art Academy,<br>making it tuition free, but taking a percent cut, is important.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But before you get there,<br>know that you will also need to teach all the classes that enable digital painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How to put a Desktop together, how to install Linux and Krita.<br>and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you will also need to offer, programming Krita extensions classes,<br>compiling and extending Krita, GIMP, and similar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the more art related lectures about Generative Programming,<br>how to write P5.js, how to program SVG files, and make them reactive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The future of the Academy is about becoming a complete and real school,<br>one that has an independent educational curriculum... from the fantasy education of the standardized curriculum.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You also have to recognize your limits,<br>and that you deserve to have a good stress-fee life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is why you need help from your friends,<br>no one should be burdened or forced into things that don't move them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And realize that there is no future in centralized education,<br>neither brick and mortar nor a website that can shut down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your school needs to be distributed the way large computer games are,<br>and it needs to operate when disconnected from the internet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art sells, your Academy, can help people out of poverty,<br>it must be a reliable program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The online component should be limited to sales,<br>here <span>Dribbble<sup>[1]</sup></span> and <span>Creative Market<sup>[2]</sup></span> are good examples of an Art Academy store front.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You also need to invent a new class of software,<br>that will allow for rapid development.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an event based system,<br>where things listen and respond to well-named events, for example "Student Sign-up Form Submission" or "Visit To Home Page"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Event based systems can be represented by graphs,<br>where a node represents an event and an edge (or connecting line) a connection to one of the events that can be triggered from there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However leave graphs for last,<br>because you need to build out a collaborative environment first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It works very similar to wikipedia,<br>but articles are the events (or graph nodes).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the home page of this system opens,<br>one of the things you will see there is "Visit To Home Page" event.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you click on that,<br>you will find English descriptions of what the visit does, and on a side bar what events can be triggered from there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The text will be written in BDD's Given When Then syntax<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>this will allow the students to collaboratively build the Academy inside out, while leaving the actual programming to developers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like <span>MediaWiki<sup>[4]</sup></span> use SQL tables,<br>lean from MediaWiki the technology behind WikiPedia for ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your most difficult challenge is already solved,<br>overlaying reference images over the drawing canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Serves as both reference for shapes,<br>and a perfect palette.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a simple idea,<br>that anybody can learn, with minimal practice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Soon your store-front will fill with art,<br>your crowd-sourcing engine will fill with art requests that your students can fulfill for money, where yo take a percent cut to expand the academy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make no mistake your Academy Of Art,<br>is meant to change the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The academy of Art is meant to save students from debt,<br>and offer real education, that shows real results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People of the world need real education,<br>one that improves their Knowledge, enhances their wisdom, and ignites their greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is necessary for Humanity to advance,<br>beyond broken ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of Universal Income and Tolerance of Poverty,<br>or destroying food so that the hungry can't eat it and prices can remain high - is not who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each generation,<br>has a chance to redefine the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And each chance,<br>requires but a seed that only later grow into a tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Academy of Art, is just one small idea that life will present to you,<br>but if it calls to you, then this is your path to Greatness.</div>
