    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you feel that your thoughts don't add up to much,<br>or end up in circle, or become Swiss cheese it means you need more books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a while things begin making sense,<br>it is still difficult to navigate, but your thoughts don't run short.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You shouldn't be afraid of thinking yourself into a loop,<br>and when you do end up in the beginning, it just means you need books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Getting at books is tough,<br>because to read a book you need peace within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You won't be able to make peace outside,<br>but with courage you can make peace within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly, with travel and adventure,<br>you will begin inheriting wisdom from others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will discover that everything that is wrong with the world,<br>is lack of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those three things,<br>are just words that describe growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Growing up is what we do,<br>we are really good at it, because we can build more wisdom out of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually,<br>you will take a look back at your younger self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by subtle analogy understand,<br>that people are not learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That they are stuck in loops,<br>scared of thoughts unraveling and turning to string or Swiss cheese.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the great human traditions,<br>is to become a teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you help them across,<br>you help them to books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them become strong,<br>so that they too may contemplate the world on their own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The higher you will rise in your education,<br>the more wrongs you will see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pretenders will be the most frightening,<br>they sound exactly like the wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is an intent to mislead in all they do,<br>at the very least they want people to follow behind them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a quirk in the human psychology,<br>and makes very poor and ill people feel better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not that different,<br>from people holding up the color of their skin as superior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pretenders do not have complete thoughts,<br>their thoughts are unraveled, cut up, inauthentic, tragic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Their claim to leadership is a fantasy,<br>and they prey on people with un-integrated thoughts making them follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than helping them to books,<br>and making each of them a leader and a grow up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pretenders feed them temporary things,<br>that give the followers impression of some progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A person will have a tendency to follow,<br>because it is easier than creating their own path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The act of finding the strength or courage to to keep whole long enough<br>to begin inheriting from countless books, is more difficult than fantasizing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easier to walk into a place of fantasy,<br>or instantly join some group by waiving their flag.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you rise, you will discover,<br>just how many fantasy based groups and institutions there are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity didn't just stop at ice giants, magic,<br>or cults or religions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Entire nations become corrupted,<br>with un-integrated and disconnected thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are not working,<br>they operate on grades and graduations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Irrelevant and incomprehensible, unstable cirricula,<br>that push students away from learning and comprehension.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And instead force them towards pretending and memorization,<br>under the threat of ridicule, being held back, poverty and hunger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is one of the great tragedies of our age,<br>that people agree to pretend to learn in exchange for a diploma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It gets even worse,<br>we are all born into a world that invented the concept of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then promptly misused it,<br>to choke it self with poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't lose yourself in overwork,<br>money is a problem that needs repair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And poverty is not just about homelessness, or hunger,<br>it actually prevents people from learning and growing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is fine for banks to fight for a dollar,<br>it is fine for Wall St. to trade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a human being,<br>must never become victim of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inflation will only occur if the world,<br>continues its semi random walk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The correct application of money,<br>starts with the individual and and their universal income card.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The flow must come from an individual with a universal income card,<br>and only then move towards a business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not start with with hospitals and businesses,<br>ignoring human suffering, misfortune and hunger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond that, it is easy for an ineffective leader to stabilize an uneducated nation,<br>when everyone is put in their place with poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Money has been used as an all-purpose hot glue,<br>to give an impression of a functioning and coherent government or world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A day or two reviewing politics will reveal,<br>that influential people are only reacting and with partial knowledge, and none have any solid grasp on reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The same confusion and feeling of thinking ourselves into circles,<br>has permeated our entire world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But here when nations think themselves in a circle in their collective ineffective-education,<br>they often find themselves repeating their worst mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The same that we feel before we begin inheriting from wise books,<br>has cast the world into confusion and sometimes darkness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Leaders who in their blindness drive the world,<br>into poverty, disagreement, confusion, and crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then bring repair with weapons manufacturing,<br>mass incarceration and war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May seem like they are making repairs pr progress,<br>but their minds have long unraveled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is is not possible,<br>to prevent the world from repeating mistakes today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one person,<br>can lead the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are too many pretenders,<br>and it is all to easy for them to lie to their uneducated followers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only hope there is, is with your generation,<br>and the young generations that follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By taking to real adventure and real education, and powerful challenges,<br>and thus becoming knowledgeable and wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Entire generations of young people can,<br>can bring light, reason, wisdom, to all that is poisoned by ineffective education and broken thinking today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The future of the world never rested,<br>with the Poets, Philosophers, Politicians, or Profiteering Gluttons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As by the time <strong>they</strong> reached their maturity,<br>they've become all too warped and caught up in an incomplete system of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has always been with those, who have not yet been indoctrinated into the broken ways of the world,<br>turning their hopes and dreams to reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you and your generation, can gather the strengths and courage for long enough,<br>to resist the pressures of the broken world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And independently learn from countless powerful books, that grant you a clear and just views of the future.<br>A picture of a world free from fake education, poverty, and constant thereat of nuclear or any other war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you can have the world,<br>that is worthy of you.</div>
