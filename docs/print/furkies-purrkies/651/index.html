  <div class="paragraph">This here is a ballad,<br>about the invention of a new kind of salad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My invention begun with rediscovery of fruit,<br>that it makes any vegetable taste good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After many years of research and relaxation,<br>I hereby list the ingredients in celebration.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The most important of them all is the Raspberry Fruit spread,<br>enough said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fruit spread enriches two things,<br>thus giving the salad wings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First, it makes all vegetables taste like fruit,<br>seriously even picky kids will think they taste good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Second - and you have to give it a try,<br>it prevents the much needed Jalapeño (gatito grande habla español), from making you cry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just sure your Jalapeño is not too hot,<br>and I promise you will like it a lot.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Jalapeño can be pickled or freshly picked,<br>the rules of my salad are not very strict.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Likewise the vegetables can be fresh or frozen,<br>so as long as you make sure there is about a dozen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to lay it all out on a bed,<br>made out of shredded lettuce, sunflower seeds, and a bit of bread.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">That vegetables turn to fruit when they touch a sweet raspberry or strawberry,<br>is my favorite discovery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I’ve thus created Jalapeñoberry,<br>where depending on spiciness results may wary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sweet Pepperberries were very nice,<br>and I had many a slice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had Cornberries,<br>which reminded me of cranberries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though my carrots were a bit old,<br>the Carrotberries were pure gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I even tasted a baked Potatoberry,<br>and the taste was nice and very airy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Squashberry was especially neat,<br>as the Jalapeño gave it a bit of heat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I actually enjoyed a huge Broccoliberry,<br>which used to be my vegetable adversary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I added the fruit spread to a strawberry,<br>I think, I might have invented a berryberry.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure that whatever new fruits you create,<br>will taste just great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Good times is what’s all about,<br>I hope you will soon the salad to try it out.</div>
