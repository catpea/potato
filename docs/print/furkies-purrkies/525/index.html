    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self Education is tested with progress and real little achievements,<br>whereas all the other types, are graded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what grades are,<br>but I know it is easy to memorize disconnected facts, and we quickly forget it all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the moment we get tricked to gather good grades,<br>we kind of stop learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The threat of repeating classes or being held back is very real,<br>we get pushed into pretending to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not to mention all the crazed and unfair teachers, school bullies, and meangless things,<br>and sitting in rows, and everything being cut up in 45 minute cubes and mixed up into a memorization salad sprinkled with homework.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then college, somehow, for some crazy reason,<br>starts charging money, for more pretending.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They sell this promise of a career,<br>but only if you and your parents give them all your savings and then some.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The real questions remain, unchanged by fantasies,<br>we still have to ask if graduates get a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to ask the big questions as well, like how is their mental health,<br>where are they going in life, how wise have they become, what are the regrets of their elder selves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How has their compassion for other human beings flourished,<br>how will they make the world a better place, what is their legacy, and how lasting their contributions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then we have to ask,<br>what if students were learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What if that perfect GPA, that was fueled by stress, freaking-out, and cramming,<br>was replaced with actual achievement, not imaginary grades - but real things instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph"><span>What if music class started off with 27 minute and 51 second tutorial on music composition with lmms<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and only ended when someone felt proud to show off their song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>What if art class taught instant results even with inexpensive mirror projectors<sup>[2]</sup></span><br>and by the time the first lesson was up everyone had a perfect portrait they loved.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning math is like trying to learn driving by memorizing all the screws in a car,<br>the way math is taught is a terrible mistake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The beauty of mathematics is best appreciated,<br>by fist learning a little bit of programming and then <span>falling in love with math formulas<sup>[3]</sup></span> by means of <span>generative art<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are taught to hate math,<br>that is so sad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than just real results,<br>what if schools taught us to bring things together and create bigger things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that the students that liked music,<br>created synthesizers, or programs to automatically remix songs, or even great a new generation of boom boxes out of miniature computers and vintage hardware.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students who liked art would print 10 foot sculptures with 3D printers,<br>or generated infinite and fascinating generative art, that could fill a museum, both with visitors and works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when time came to go to High School,<br>the students would be graded by how well they tend to their Business Start-ups.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And in real college - that wouldn't dare to charge a cent -<br>we took to philosophy, science, wisdom and greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first lesson would open with,<br>"Growing up has nothing to do with getting older".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we took to trying to solve real problems,<br>like the problem of Nuclear Weapons being fueled up are ready to launch 24/7.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Problem on national borders that creates the conditions,<br>that push uneducated men, into sending their children into war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course poverty, we invented money,<br>and trapped every human being in a cycle of stress and poverty, without actually intending to do so.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Beautiful and wise biographies and non-fiction read in a sequence that suits us best and at a comfortable pace,<br>are so much more meaningful, that one can only wonder what are schools are actually for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until real schools exist,<br>we can't just go along with cramming, memorizing, <strong>paying</strong> for fake-ish education, and pretending that it is all a good plan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is so much more meaningful,<br>and so much more real, filled with memorable milestones, and countless lovely creations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most beautiful thing about real education,<br>is that it helps us to great health, and great adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not end in some silly fantasy of graduation,<br>as in real life we grow to no end, we grow all the way up, until we become Great Beings.</div>
