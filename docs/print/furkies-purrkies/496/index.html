      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Curious Things</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The philosophy related to your interests,<br>is very important, because it can help you learn in extremely powerful and meaningful ways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After High School I had an idea about putting MP3 files,<br>on a CD, and turning CR-ROM drives into Car MP3 Players.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Looking back, I can see that the MP3 player patent was filed few years back,<br>but my idea was still really good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made the mistake of contacting a company advertising on TV,<br>they sat down with me, and said patent would cost 10,000 dollars, with weasel words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If that was an honest company and they only took 10% of sales,<br>and invested some money upfront to get this thing rolling, maybe something would come out of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, what really needed to happen, is me taking matters in my own hands,<br>instead of playing with weasels, I needed to learn Electronics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see what the problem was, I misinterpreted my interest my curiosity,<br>this was a call to learn Electronics along with Programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not for a job, or money,<br>just to know how it all works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just to have,<br>more knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And today I sat down after my workout,<br>and I sketched out a small MP3 player that I need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I need it to have buttons, that I can feel though my pocket,<br>so that I don't have to look at the darn thing to skip to the next song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I sketched out a device based on a Raspberry PI,<br>I really like the ability to connect to it with a computer and phone, and upload music or change settings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that way it does not really need a screen,<br>it just needs to be an <span>Aluminum Enclosure<sup>[1]</sup></span> with room for 9 buttons that I will drill and program in different ways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what I should have done in 1998,<br>I should have been searching aluminum enclosures and <span>fancy potentiometers<sup>[2]</sup></span> with <span>beautiful aluminum knobs<sup>[3]</sup></span>, and some way to decode MP3 music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Back then there was no Raspberry PI Zero,<br>so the project wasn't as interesting, but lesson learned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had an opportunity to begin learning electronics,<br>and I ruined it, because I needed to get a job in Web Design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must ignore what people are telling us to do,<br>and focus on doing what we feel strongly about, because that is bound to expand our knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the thing about Knowledge is that it doesn't matter what you are learning,<br>so as long as you are creating that library of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bigger your library the more new things you will be able to approach,<br>by subtle analogy to what you already know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is one of the problems with school,<br>it teaches little un-integrated things, breadcrumbs, where what we need is vast cities, cross connected by highways of curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is more, you also have to do things in the correct sequence,<br>and if you feel like it, do the things that make most interesting results first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of looking for <span>Raspberry PI UPS and Batteries<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>I put my sketches away, hosed my elf down with bug spray.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And mumbled "Maybe, I can fix my first Fat Tire bicycle, and have two Fat Tire Bicycles, by day's end",<br>my first Fat Tire bicycle seemed to have a damaged tire, there was visible damage around the rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, it turned out that the damage wasn't affecting the tire,<br>that years ago, I simply didn't know how to properly inflate tires, and my first Fat Tire bike wasn't broken at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So both of them are operational now, I tested the newest repairs with a ten mile run,<br>and it worked perfectly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bicycle seat broke on me, so I had to get a new one, and I got a big and comfy one,<br>I suffered two paper cuts, and two mosquito bites, and initially when I got on it the chain fell of, and I had to fix it on the sidewalk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it was worth it, both of them are parked in my living room,<br>where I did majority of the repairs and they look really fun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I didn't prioritize fixing my bicycle,<br>I'd have nothing to ponder this evening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So even though, great inventions or magnificent patents call to us,<br>it is probably better to create a little road of lessons and small achievements on our way there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going to school is not about graduating,<br>but learning useful things, things that for example would help me make my MP3 player.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to move in a way that grants us these beautiful colorful little achievements,<br>not just a job, diploma, and a patent, but a vast highway of countless curiosities satisfied.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't cram for a test, and we can't call memorization and education,<br>and when we do stand up for real education...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't allow the teachers to convince the class that we are just gifted,<br>because entire classrooms have to stand up for real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It should be that all the high school students, have their own MP3 players,<br>some with 4G modems, others with synthesizers that can sample sounds and crank out mean hip-hop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The paths that we take should consist of real things,<br>that add up to grant us real powers, real talents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For those who think that it would be impossible to roll Math education into Electronics and Programming,<br>because High School is only four rears, then know that school shouldn't be cut up into pieces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our education lasts a life time,<br>and institutions that clam to teach should be ready to support that; and not give reasons why that won't fit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The road of small and colorful achievements,<br>is also the path of self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All it takes, is reminding ourselves to slow down,<br>that it is better to expand our knowledge in 10,000 ways, than just one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially when prioritizing a job or carrier, or some patent,<br>over 10,000 lessons that really call to us, that make us more of who we are, that feel like a great adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Call it a Jack of all trades, and a master of some<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>call it genius, call it early retirement, call it achievement, call it prioritization of the most fantastic things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But don't let anybody push you away from the things that are calling-out to you,<br>because no school could ever possibly match the education that you get from satisfying your most meaningful curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, know that there is a sequence to your beautiful road of achievements,<br>you can't leap into being passionate about Music, Art, Philosophy, and you can't squeeze a decade of pondering something, into just reading another book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to let things grow in us, I am pretty convinced that if I didn't have my little MP3 player idea in 1998,<br>then I wouldn't be so interested in building it now out of a Raspberry PI Zero, and other fancy 2020 technologies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am certain that I would not be able to fix my old bike,<br>if I don't continue riding, and slowly learning on my own how to fix and teak bicycle things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't leap into knowing how to restore a bicycle back to life,<br>you have to spend a few years dancing around with it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Answering curiosities, is self education, this is real functional education, that creates real and lasting results, that solves problems that you really do have,<br>it is not possible for a school to enlighten you this way about all your 10,000 curiosities, for one, it takes a life time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And most importantly, at the end of the day, we end up, with a pile of stuff that we really like, will never get tired of, and we are proud of,<br>all our diagrams, bicycles, computer program, electronic circuits and inventions, adventure photos, drawings, paintings, sculptures, music, poetry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't let people push you into a diploma and a career,<br>walk your own way and become an unstoppable and timeless Force Of Nature.</div>
