    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art is more,<br>because it's unconstrained.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A great man once said that out final freedom,<br>is to choose how we face the inescapable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But art shows that there is infinitely more,<br>because our ability to dream is infinite.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art is the way to make dreams last,<br>last long enough to never be forgotten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art is not just the books we write,<br>or the paintings we paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just the marble sculpture,<br>that breathes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art is the extension of dreams,<br>and yet it is also found in the way we live our lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How we triumph over the sickened bullies,<br>by not becoming the snarling beasts that they are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How we become unbreakable by ignoring the simpler wrong,<br>and taking the much harder right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And how our awe for great beings,<br>teaches us not to kneel but to rise even higher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And though a broken school can do its best to dull curiosity,<br>its source within is unending.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just the majestic choice,<br>but the very mechanics of being human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you follow each step with another,<br>you cannot be helped but to travel unlimited roads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you add one profound book to another,<br>you cannot help but to become wiser than both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And above all when our paths overwhelm us,<br>we become greater to continue on our way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as we reject all that does not do us justice,<br>we cannot help but to rise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All that has added up to make Humanity better,<br>was conceived of by ordinary humans and our extraordinary powers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each generation learns from the art of the previous,<br>art inspired by all that is good across all human history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must remind the little ones,<br>that they are meant to become great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That in the absence of real schools,<br>they have to become the teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And remind them that poverty is not a fault of theirs,<br>but like all the other wrongs, an error, to be repaired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To the little ones belongs the world,<br>we have to remind them, that they are meant to grow <strong>all</strong> the way up.</div>
