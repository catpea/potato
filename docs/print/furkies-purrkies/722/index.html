    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is one of the best things that can happen to you,<br>because then you are stuck with your beautiful art portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if you deleted your art portfolio,<br>you can't wash away the fact, that you are an artist, now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have your portfolio,<br>and a dream of a business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But before you is a gap,<br>and it requires that you build a bridge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is called, a beginning,<br>that is how every business entrepreneur starts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The gap and the bridge,<br>is a blessing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you are not doing business for business sake,<br>here you have a reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You become driven,<br>you learn without trying, and you advance without pushing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you realize that kind of paying the bills is not enough,<br>it will take but a moment of rest, to invent the next step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The next step that builds on top of your beautiful art portfolio,<br>that indestructible nucleus that is all the proof you can do it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your beautiful, nine piece art portfolio,<br>born of hope, realism, inspiration, comprehension, understanding, rage, and rebellion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ignited by the deceptively simple process of placing a transparent reference image,<br>over your entire canvas to allow you to pick the correct colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is a a magical ticket,<br>out of the world of darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Print out the pieces of nine,<br>hold it in your hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look at all the details you put there,<br>all the pixels that you put there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And notice, how that dark fantasy of sick men,<br>of creatures that sold the word.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Trembles before you,<br>how the sickens of the broken men has no power over you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your pieces of nine,<br>truly, fully, deeply, are a magical ticket that helps you rise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You take out your journal,<br>that has the sticker version of your pieces of nine plastered all over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you start building the bridge,<br>you work on the systems diagrams.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a very simple program,<br>a person comes to the website, uploads an image, for about $50 dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The image goes into a task queue,<br>someone scores it for quality, talk to the customer about improvements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the artists that signed up with your company,<br>begin their work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Three artists that like the photo, create a total of nine images,<br>and the customer orders two of them to completion, $50 each.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a total of $150 dollars the customer gets two unique portraits,<br>you take %25 percent of that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the artists, don't just make the money,<br>they add another piece to their portfolio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">During sign-up, you train your artists to use Krita,<br>and stretch the reference image using Reference Images Tool over the entire canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where it becomes both perfect color,<br>and perfect shape reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let your artists form guilds that adhere to a particular technique,<br>and let them create their own storefronts under the umbrella of your system, it all works out great in the end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whenever an artist brings users to their own store,<br>it generates new traffic to the whole website, which is good for all artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you should allow thousands,<br>or tens of thousands artists to sign up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And though you can try to have a "there will be no slightly crooked paintings sold by your business" guarantee,<br>people will come in and trance from reference, and that is good too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A good part of art,<br>is meditation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see, if your initial business worked out,<br>all you would be able to do is pay the bills, and get some gadgets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But because there was a gap,<br>your heart was challenged to innovate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To grow from Artist to Entrepreneur,<br>from few hundred dollars, to just about 10 million per month.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grow in creativity, passion, hope, imagination, adventure cheerfulness,<br>and a gentle and beautiful vision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A vision that surely,<br>can remind all how amazing it is to have portraits of people they love - painted just for them in the colors they love - hanging all around their house.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course, it is not all love, all the time,<br>hopefully you will have a Lowbrow Art option for that uncle that talks politics all the time, where people can choose from the following options.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one eye bigger than the other,<br>pant-less in grandmother pantaloons,<br>tiny little mouth,<br>extra wrinkles,<br>eye patch,<br>googly eyes,<br>strange hat,<br>handcuffs,<br>missing tooth...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally, prevent the artist from tracing the likeness even with some extra loose technique,<br>and make the final outcome slightly crooked, so that everyone has to equally slightly pretend is it good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nah, its good, its really good,<br>it looks like him... you are very talented - you were always very talented as a child"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Actually you spoke before your father did,<br>after he found out about my pregnancy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tremendous,<br>talent...</div>
