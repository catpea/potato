    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I took the <span>Blender Doughnut Tutorial<sup>[1]</sup></span> today,<br>and the first level is not bad at all - Keyboard Shortcuts and Little Buttons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have been looking into Blender as a backup to FreeCAD,<br>but also it is good for the soul to develop patience for special need programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have spent a little bit more time in Inkscape, a 2D program,<br>it has very good features.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I have also spent a moment thinking about paper,<br>as it is reasonable to draw a design on paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will require conversion to SVG,<br>and in some cases can be used in a 3D sculpting program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My initial designs were squares,<br>the latest design, is me drawing with a line tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not a free hand tool,<br>but a tool that draws straight lines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, by pressing the control key,<br>you are only allowed to make angles in 15 degree increments.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The designs almost design themselves,<br>this is within <span>Inkscape<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a tool,<br>that prevents crooked doodles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The latest design that is shown in the title picture,<br>is mostly a random arrangement of 2D shapes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a study,<br>in what a more deliberate design process would feel like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Inkscape in particular has helpful tools for arranging objects evenly,<br>evenly distributing spaces between objects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When a 2D design is imported to FreeCAD, it can be converted to a sketch,<br>but the sketch will need hundreds of constraints, 700 in this case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the program demands can be ignored,<br>so as long as all the objects that will later become holes by means of Boolean Cuts, are solid paths.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had them set as lines and FreeCAD would get confused,<br>a hole in the SVG will not translate to a hole in FreeCAD, it will become an object that needs to go through the Boolean Cut process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is where Blender comes in,<br>blenders ability to convert an SVG into a 3D object is a matter of setting the imported SVG object extrusion value under Geometry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In my case here it is 2mm,<br>Blender can export the object, but in case of TinkerCAD it must be scaled a 1,000 times during export.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender's default scene is in meters,<br>it is just easier to enter 1000 during export then mess with the settings.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">By using Blender with a Slicer that generates gcode that 3D printers and other machines understand,<br>it is hard to see any limitations to any kind of design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">FreeCAD seems to be a more serious program,<br>it is meant to create tools and parts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender, takes the concept to the maximum,<br>and far beyond manufacturing.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There was a cartoon that I watched a few times when I was little,<br>it was called <span>Enchanted Pencil<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Three minutes fifty seconds into the cartoon<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>a Gnome appears for no reason, and hands the main character a magical pencil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The boy then copies a tattoo on a nearby sleeping admiral,<br>and the drawing magically appears in reality.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>3D pens that extrude the same kind of filament that 3D printers use do exist<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>but making 3D drawings free hand is a different process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very artistic through, and the filament work does smooth out with a hot knife and some filling,<br>it is just that one can't make perfect copies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But that is what 3D modeling of real world objects feels like to me,<br>it is like using a magical pencil.</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>It seems almost everyone is using wallets to refine their work flow<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>it certainly makes for an interesting hobby.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bought a little CR2030 battery,<br>and while it was still in packaging I pierced it with a pin and slid in a 5mm led.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been on all afternoon,<br>I can tell the green LED needs more juice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just jabbed in a red one in there and it looks fantastic,<br>all it takes is a pair of calipers to create a useless wallet feature, that will make all the difference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've noticed many wallet designs have little little ports for MicroSD cards,<br>and even card adapters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I continue using elastic string during my initial research,<br>that's what the round holes are for in the title image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I've notices people using rubber washers or bands to create simple hinges,<br>and a handful of designs takes that extra step and feature an actual mechanical hinge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creating a proper hinge is simple math,<br>and a hinge can be printed per-assembled which is yet another fantastic tangent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite idea in the world of wallets,<br>is of course Generative Wallets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A program would follow simple logic to outline an SVG design,<br>it would randomly choose from ideas about each of the corners, rounded, exposed, square with an extrusion, etc.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a handful of randomly set parameters,<br>the wallet design would emerge out of random chaos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover once could display nine wallets,<br>and allow the user to choose which of the features look most fetching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then re generate nine new designs,<br>that select for what the features previously picked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Borrowing from the process of evolution,<br>though I prefer non-interactive product generation, myself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I want to hold this up as an example of Real Education,<br>something that can be learned in 7th grade, and mastered by high school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though this is just printing,<br>it is also a lesson in business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It shows a young mind that there is a small gap between an original invention,<br>and an online store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">High school graduation, should end with all the students being equipped with an independent business,<br>most of the time it would be multiple co-founders, as it is easier - but that is not the rule.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here the students would see that they don't need to graduate into more debt and more poverty,<br>but rather have something that <span>pushes all the fears of post-graduation back<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
