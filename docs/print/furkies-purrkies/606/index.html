    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A week before Philosophy finals, where we spent the semester going over Descartes,<br>a boy in the back got up and asked who is this des-cartes guy, mispronouncing Descartes' name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fraudulent professor was out of the class,<br>but all the students felt really ashamed, the class was a failure, it was fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The boy showed us, how we all participated in fraud,<br>this was not a Philosophy class, it was a study in Self Deception and Academic Fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to carefully examine the impressions you are getting from the world around you,<br>and you have to examine the authenticity of things you are participating in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can see that the teacher dumbed down the lectures and that grades are arbitrarily set to keep the fraud hidden,<br>you got to go, you have to get up, and go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you wait too long to get up,<br>the reality of participating in fake education will hurt.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I took Art, Sculpture and more Programming, because I needed my classmates in my life,<br>I just wanted to be around amazing people, a little bit more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the Dean delivered the final blow,<br>I made the Deans list in my wanderings, I had a perfect 4.0.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the worst thing that happened in my life,<br>I realized that schools were fake - it was all make believe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are people out there who are unlucky enough to have someone say, on their first day of work:<br>"Forget everything you learned in college, here is what you need to know..." - that one must really hurt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">25, 35, 45, 65, 75, and at 80 we finally ask,<br>"What was the point of that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is just how fraud an in-authenticity works,<br>you go down a slick well oiled pipe, and people take your money a little bit at a time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is that you can move any mountain,<br>so as long as it moves <strong>you</strong> first - so as long as it calls to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies, descriptions of lives of other people who were manipulated in a way that you recognize from your own life,<br>create a pivot point, granting you an opportunity, to get out of that early,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The point is not just about not being manipulated though,<br>the point is in becoming a Great Being, because it is the full bouquet of all that you can be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In greatness, you become both your own Professor, and a Forever Student,<br>and become the change, that you want to see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness is the Point,<br>you are meant to become a great being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The diploma is a sticker that you place on your outside,<br>but greatness is the roar that comes from your deepest integrities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In life you may find that you are surrounded by naked emperors,<br>who are hollow on the inside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose to become a Great Being,<br>you will expand your Nobility and Dignity, Wisdom and Content Of Character.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no one path to greatness, you are as unique as your interests and curiosities,<br>and all the things that call to you in the cheerful privacy of your mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Walk the path that is dictated by your interests, curiosities, things that call to you;<br>things that you are passionate about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way you never get stuck,<br>a true writer does not ever get a writer's block.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a life where the point is to become a Great Being,<br>every one of your days is a significant part of your whole, whether you see it or not.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take to books, each one of them carries a precious unique story.<br>books will help you to easily inherit other peoples hard won wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Know that becoming a Great Being is your right,<br>you should never let anyone stand in your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each step towards greatness,<br>will always help you become a little bit wiser and see a little bit more.</div>
