      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Quo Vadis?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That schools are broken is one terrible thing,<br>you are meant to stand far above that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to be more than just self educating,<br>you are meant to be powering up, all that is all too human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It doesn't even matter what is coming,<br>you are to learn great things as a function of being human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a great being,<br>you are meant to move mountains.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A world that does not emphasize greatness,<br>will become a world of actors, performers, pretenders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those kinds of people are not well,<br>they just put on a proud face and go with the flow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember that being manipulated by an actor,<br>is imperceptible - that is the definition of manipulation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think all that liars want is not to be caught,<br>hence the energetic effort at projecting leadership.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real leadership is about preventing dead ends,<br>not waiting until all but desperate choices are available.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A world that does not emphasize greatness,<br>will lack the necessary wisdom to build schools, to provide real safety.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, Humanity comes together,<br>and more often than not fixes everything at the very last second...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is not the way it is done,<br>foresight and comprehension, wisdom and greatness is how it is done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Last second prevention can fail sometimes,<br>and it is not who we are anyway.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other end, we can't hope to fix things by means of destruction,<br>we learn that from the hydra that grows two heads in place of the one that was cut off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In short,<br>destruction magnifies hate, and we are creators not destroyers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to set kindergarten level ideas aside,<br>and understand that wisdom and greatness are the true forces of change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are forces of creation, of bringing understanding,<br>of setting people free from prisons whose walls they cannot see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Borders do not make humanity better or more stable,<br>if anything they are used to mislead and harm the most vulnerable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity, in reality has no rulers,<br>it is too vast, too noble, and far too collectively wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have people who take care of paperwork,<br>so that we can take care of our lives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those are not leaders,<br>they should not decide on matters that steer humanity, they just need to take care of paperwork.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only Humanity can set its course,<br>and we need to understand that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are one family, and we all have to rise,<br>and we have to look far into distant futures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our most important duty,<br>is to make sure the little ones have a great and cheerful future.</div>
