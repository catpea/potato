      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Fanciful Event Emitter: A Super Strange Programming Poem</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Event happens when you click a mouse,<br>it is called the click event.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The event comes with some information,<br>and that information is just named values, like x=5, or user=alice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Emitter means that we can emit events,<br>we can say emit alert “Hello!”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Listener must be setup,<br>to hear events.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some Event Emitter libraries,<br>allow you to create wildcards, so you can hear all or some events.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And one time I’ve read someone was challenged<br>to create a simple program by their potential employer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They used Event Emitter,<br>to create this beautiful web of information.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the company,<br>hated it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was supposed to do it the most minimalist way,<br>so that other employees would know what is going on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bare bone minimalism<br>shows that the person understands the technologies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And knows how to use them,<br>in a way that others usually use them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead he invented this whole new abstraction,<br>that meant other programmers needed to learn to understand it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So he needed to program their way,<br>so that they could easily read the code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">During the interview doing things the hard way,<br>shows that a person did not skip learning about them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was so surprised,<br>he asked about it on the internet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other hand,<br>people invent extra technologies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">MooTools, jQuery, Backbone,<br>and the more modern React, Vue, Svelte, and helpers like lodash or PouchDB.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone loves that,<br>as these are real time savers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now I think this person could have,<br>created a time saver.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think that company was mad for not replying to him,<br>and just full of brainless yes-people anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wouldn't even touch an interview like that,<br>my knowledge is vast and carefully compiled since I was nine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t want anybody,<br>to insult me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Having said that, this gentleman who failed the interview,<br>picked the correct technology.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A nice clean EventEmitter is probably the most powerful way,<br>to write real code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I f you write your entire application EventEmitter first,<br>it becomes like a dream, it is like thought programming, a digital day dream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may only have the scaffold made out of listeners,<br>some simple if statements, and emitters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But oh wow, you can just send a packet down the pipe,<br>and watch it travel thorough he web.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It gets better, because if you use simple visual programming,<br>or just <span>graph visualization<sup>[1]</sup></span>, as in graph theory (very simple).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, you can see the web,<br>the event network of your program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike classical visual programming,<br>where what you get is what you drag and drop into the canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Graph theory, graph database, web socket based even communication between clinet and server,<br>and a code generator that will make the EventEmitter code perfect, will all go a long way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A graph database has two concepts, one is that of an node, vertex, bag or box,<br>and an edge, or wire, just wire that connects the boxes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Both wire and box, have a unique id,<br>so you can use that as a filename or object name or row ID.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just let the graph live in RAM,<br>and save only what changes, or save changes to a log, very simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all cut up into tiny bits by default,<br>where graph databases are concerned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A graph’s circles and lines,<br>are perfect for visualising EventEmitters with their wires and boxes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If we allow ourselves to think of a Listener,<br>as a person with a radio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We might as well put them next to a pipe,<br>that will transform whatever they send through it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if the Event Listener is a start of a chain of operations,<br>then those operations can be visually represented with more circles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A listener is a circle outline, the chain of functions are filled circles,<br>because functions is where the code sits.</div>
</div>

  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here we meet our nemesis, the branching if statement,<br>and just as quickly we turn them into just another EventListener with a chain of functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be hard to track all the code, for all the different listeners,<br>but since we are visualizing it graphically, that is not a problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to tracking variables, that is not even an issue,<br>all the variables are listed by just clicking on the listener, the data is in the event.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As always such fascinating curiosities,<br>are a great way to learn and practice programming.</div>
