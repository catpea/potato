  <div class="paragraph">Great things start from humble beginnings,<br>and without humble beginnings you can't create great things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all - of course - too unique to share the same beginning,<br>but there are some beginnings that are incredibly entertaining.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will attempt to describe to you a couple of weekend long adventures,<br>that will give you a taste of your own genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whether you are just starting out,<br>or things got too busy and you forgot about your genius - this text is for you.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Let us begin with the most outrageous weekend first,<br>you are going to <span>Nordhouse<sup>[1]</sup></span> to roast a sausage over a freakhhhing fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a closer look at the Nordhouse beach,<br>using your favorite satellite photo service.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see those little bright lines?<br>those are access points to camp sites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People that camp there make a path to get to the beach,<br>each one of those sites has neat fire spot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to stay the night,<br>you just need a stick, a sausage, and a little fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't like driving to adventures,<br>than of my gosh that is like the most sophisticated thing I have ever heard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you live in the Detroit area where I am writing this from,<br>you should know that the I-275 Bicycle trail - inexplicably!...</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Passes through a tent site with fire rings<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and proper restrooms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't live in Michigan,<br>get to the nearest lake that has campsites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you don't like meat, you are in luck,<br>because you get to roast a Marshmallows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And don't forget,<br>the mosquito repellent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure to visit your favorite campsite every few weekends,<br>while the weather is nice.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Now that you made some room for yourself,<br>it is time to spend a weekend with art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But before you get there,<br><span>order a pico or a mini projector<sup>[3]</sup></span>, maybe one that connects to your phone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, <span>go to you favorite museum<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and ask what would it take to become an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right after your museum visit, <span>go shopping for proper pencils<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>go to a coffee shop and <span>and draw a photo realistic eye<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a tutorial video on the internet for everything,<br>just search for draw an eye, or draw a face, or even speed drawing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And search for <span>black and white portraits<sup>[7]</sup></span> use a projector to map out a face,<br>make sure your source image has high contrast, dark dark, and bright whites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And <span>find a tutorial about drawing faces<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>drawing hair<sup>[9]</sup></span>, and practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get some <span>Camera & Photo Lighting<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>and start taking portrait request, from your friends and family, and from strangers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And don't forget about our furry friends, if at all possible, please start referring to peoples pets,<br>as their Fur Kids, as that is something that you will never regret, and sometimes giggle about in the evening.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is one more thing that brings the two together,<br>and makes them even better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whether you are out on your weekend adventure,<br>or working on finishing up one of your portraits at the coffee shop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very important,<br>that you also listen to Narrated Books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I will list ten titles,<br>that left a lasting impression on me.</div>
