      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Note To Parents On The Subject Of Art And The Future</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the big changes that take but one step,<br>might have already happened, what humanity needs now requires multiple steps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As I write this,<br>the wold is experiencing a Pandemic, and a renewed threat of Nuclear War.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wold leaders are calling for return to office,<br>and are reading teenagers to fight in new wars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of real education really hurts the world,<br>because then, people make decisions based on what little they know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will have long dismissed impressions of fake education they have once felt,<br>and at all cost move forward without even allowing doubt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you raise a child in war,<br>they will never discover art, and may not even know to fell with their heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parents don't let your children grow up in the cultures of the past,<br>because then all our efforts will be for naught, and circles is all we'll ever get.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them rise,<br>so that their grand-kids are not forced into fighting in a Nuclear War.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today,<br>in our lack of real education...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Keywords necessary for the advancement of human kind are ridiculed,<br>all the while world peace moves further and further away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though we have a global banking system,<br>and concepts of trading futures or short selling stocks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We we are not able to see the importance of Global Universal Income<br>that eliminates poverty and by extension war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though we should never ask where that money comes from,<br>we can easily imagine it comes from a more peaceful and prosperous future that is born from Global Universal Income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When threatened by poverty,<br>humanity will not be able to get a Real and Authentic Education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And without real and authentic education,<br>we can't have real and authentic world leaders that will help humanity advance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without them,<br>we will only run in circles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Creation of art and its role in our world is hard to explain,<br>a lot of people believe that their poverty is their fault.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty is a problem with the way we understand and use money,<br>it is not allowed to use money in human affairs while crushing the world with poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If we are to use money,<br>then poverty must be eliminated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means that no human being is to fall,<br>beneath what today is considered middle class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This requires a global universal income card,<br>and everyone gets one, including criminals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is tough to steal,<br>when you don't need to anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The card must be granted to all, rich or poor,<br>it is hard to be homeless when you can afford rent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to go out of business,<br>when your customers wake up with $100 on their card every day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to live in a world,<br>that ignores poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What can a politician say, that has any meaning,<br>when he can't understand that poverty is evil - it just never occurred to him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians, have always tolerated poverty and homelessness,<br>and sending teenagers to war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that the world has no leaders,<br>nobody is in charge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that almost all people today reject the idea of free money,<br>for the purpose of elimination of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Means that there is nobody here,<br>to stand up for human rights.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like the discussion of art as means of elimination of poverty,<br>pushes us into politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Helping children to become the leaders needs,<br>also pushes us into an odd place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The leaders that the word needs,<br>so that we become more humane to each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as a bonus eliminate propaganda and nationalism,<br>religious and political borders and few other idiotic things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin on their first big test somewhere towards the end of middle school,<br>they begin the moment they are presented with a choice to memorize or to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And their biggest obstacle,<br>is actually their parents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most parents lie that they can't get a job without a diploma,<br>and threaten children with punishment for bad grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course schools do the same,<br>they threaten with shame and holding kids back a grade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reality of the matter is,<br>these jobs will pay you less and less the longer your work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will insult you with a "raise",<br>that does not take inflation under account.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will force you to smile while paying you less,<br>and forcing you to work harder...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you work your entire life away,<br>books, adventure and creativity, and growing up - be damned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wage slavery prevents people from flourishing,<br>they may appreciate wisdom...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But will never figure out,<br>that they are meant to become great beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,<br>to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life,<br>living is do dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all of the marrow of life,<br>to cut a broad swatch and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I really feed bad for saying this,<br>because this should never have come up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But your children unfortunately, need your permission,<br>to leave the classroom when presented with a test they were tricked into cramming for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are propagating the dark ages, if you really though about it,<br>I think the best you could come up with is: "How was I supposed to know" - so lets just leave it at that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By leaving the fake classroom,<br>the students will be allowed to search for something real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In this desperate and inhumane time of global poverty,<br>the definition of real education is:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A deeply inspiring and creative process,<br>that immediately presents a very-real possibility of making a little bit of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where that possibility scales on an easy ramp of self improvement,<br>and goes from a real possibility to reality with just a little bit of effort.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This describes the process of Creation and Sale of Art,<br>this may involve 3D modeling that produces shadow reference for a 3D painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it would be a very inviting experience,<br>just the creation of a few squares, to get the shadows right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The entry into the world of art,<br>must come with a very mild on-ramp.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mild and pleasant on-ramps with real results,<br>is precisely what students will seek, when allowed to look for real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you give the children the permission,<br>to reject fake and mind numbing fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they experience the noble and dignified process,<br>of creating something from the heart, in the world of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once they stop being terrified of poverty and homelessness,<br>and become stronger by knowing they can create out of imagination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will they be able to detect,<br>what wage slavery does to a mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By extension, by subtle analogy,<br>they will grasp how propaganda is fueled by fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How people who were forced in a school that granted them low knowledge,<br>can be easily pushed to make war a reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here they will understand that to help the world advance,<br>the world must be set free from poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will never comprehend the meaning of free money,<br>nobody who didn't push themselves away from fake education will grasp the concept of a more honest and humane world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The children who stopped being scared of poverty,<br>by means of being able to create works out of their hearts, alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will know to reject toxic wage slavery,<br>and encourage people towards creativity that holds the promise of financial independence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, by subtle analogy,<br>they as the future leaders, will see that the Global Income Card that raises everyone up into what is today the middle class...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is the only humane way forward,<br>as there is no profit to be made for keeping humanity poor and too scared and tired to get a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The end of poverty is the only way to advance human kind,<br>past the problems we face today; and well into Wisdom, Greatness and World Peace that is worthy of the future generations.</div>
