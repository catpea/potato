      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Freedom And Tools For Thinking</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Avoid complete pre-packaged answers that are often provided in college,<br>and assemble countless tools for thinking to fuel a factory of your knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And don't search for a list of tools for thinking as we can't learn them that way,<br>simply listen or read about lifetimes how they unfold and play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The living evolving wisdom we hold in our mind is a form of art,<br>lists and memorization only make one temporarily look smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Love of wisdom helps us see far,<br>and it does not matter where or who we are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pick the books that call to you and make the stories align,<br>your own path is something that <strong>you</strong> have to design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being given a list of books,<br>is a sign that you are being cheated by crooks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming wise is marked by,<br>by the ability to synthesize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is when there are so many thoughts on your mind,<br>that many of them become automatically aligned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To be wise and full of ideas and freely think,<br>is to have the content of our character to interlink.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is hard to do if we don't listen to or read real books,<br>as the world is a bit more complex than it looks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Inadequate education and tribal politics at a stand still,<br>will eventually impact your freedom of will.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need constant motion towards wisdom and liberty,<br>the world must not be held back by poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You simply have to pick the books that call to you,<br>that pleasantly expand your world view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often re-reading books will help you learn something new,<br>which in turn will help you with some breakthrough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is almost as if your mix of books is a healthy soup,<br>it does not need to be a well arranged group.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have loads of questions that we are working through,<br>it is difficult to predict the next thing that will help to improve our view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will be a book that will almost automatically catch your attention,<br>you just know when something will enhance your comprehension.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what browsing books is about,<br>looking around until something jumps out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need a connection to some area or subject,<br>something that your mind clicks with and does not reject.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why going to college,<br>often results in little acquisition of real knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just can't be told what to read or learn next,<br>even if we temporarily memorize in our mind can still reject the whole text.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge full of contradictions is not useful,<br>navigating life with it can be harmful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Solving contradictions represents great wealth,<br>as it is one of the pillars of mental health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Retaining disconnected often contradictory facts,<br>has profoundly negative impacts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we experience thinking ourselves into a loop,<br>that means we need that mix of books and knowledge soup.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As we are yet to assemble a way out,<br>and not accept something we were told and live in doubt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Contradictions are meant to be solved,<br>we can only be truly free when they are resolved.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You should know there is an important difference between ready made answers and tools for thinking,<br>one will make you grow, and the the other keep you shrinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no limit to the the depth and complexity of your mind,<br>and there is no limit to the beauty and inspiration you can find.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are given all the tools to make your mind great,<br>and you are not limited to some fate - the road ahead is yours to create.</div>
