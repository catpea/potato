      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">An Anonymous Open Letter To All The World&#39;s Teenagers</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will introduce you to a clock,<br>that you can use as a measuring stick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will show that Universal Income,<br>and Real Education solve the problems you will soon face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I will ask you to stage a protest,<br>and build a real school, where people can learn for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the world - that is to say your students - are ready,<br>the money for Basic Income will come from the improved future of the world that does not suffer an irreparable collapse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Money is an imaginary concept,<br>your generation will eliminate poverty, by extending the concept of money to consider the future that Humanity is headed towards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us begin;</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The backbone of your clock is the health of the Amazon Rain Forest (just because it is an ongoing issue that recently got worse),<br>Insects and Bats are your most powerful indicator, and Tigers, Rhinos and Orangutans represents all the rest you need to measure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Amazon Rain Forest is important because it is being burned, by the poor, for money,<br>they are helping themselves, at the cost of future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will find that this "by the poor, for the money",<br>is playing a major negative role everywhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is also empowering large corporations,<br>and even child labor and slavery.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Money is fine for playing pointless games at Wall St. but it you apply the idea of money to all Humanity,<br>it will be its silent and imperceptible undoing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Amazon is just the first of about a dozen no return points,<br>so, there is plenty of opportunity to get it right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let these ideas make you sad,<br>I am merely asking you and all the other readers. to become Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a <strong>very</strong> small chance that people will not know what to do,<br>or that the changes will be so slow, that no single generation will notice the disaster unfold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But more pressing than talk of distant disasters,<br>is a conversation, about avoiding needless suffering, which doubles a way to prevent said disasters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have already shown that Humanity is blind to<br>Mass Incarceration, Hunger and Famine, Poverty and Homelessness, Indoctrination and War, Slavery and Nations that violate Human Rights.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In their un-education, and fantasy lifestyles, <span>politicians are speaking of Earthen Vessels<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>and they actually attack and try to break the spirits of those who do care about injustice<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This problem is rooted in fake education,<br><span>and our ability to blindly make sense of crazy at the cost of distancing ourselves from reality and the chance to guide the world<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Those who did figure out what the real problem is, heartbreakingly for a significant period of time, have also maxed out their mental capacity to continue moving forward at the same pace<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>as no singe person can correct the problem, it will take a generation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not speak in broad abstract terms here,<br>we need to isolate an enormous problem, and fix it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then by subtle analogy,<br>apply a slight variation of the fix to everything else,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Amazon Rain Forest is your first challenge,<br>how do you get the farmers to stop burning it?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me give you a couple of warnings,<br>first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As crazy people who think watching the world burn is something that just happens,<br>are going to try to convince you that ending the destruction will destroy the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing it will destroy,<br>are the businesses that positioned themselves to make money off of human misery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are going to put the company that is destined to sell fresh canned air to your grand kids out of business,<br>and as a separate consequence, also prevent that future from happening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By solving the Amazon problem,<br>you will empty many businesses of workers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These businesses were built on wage slavery,<br>they took a bet, against advancement of humanity, and it was not a wise bet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another counter argument you will hear,<br>is people not doing anything but drugs and pleasure seeking as a result of the changes your generation institutes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Drug addicts exist because they are escaping pain,<br>they can't quit drugs, as drugs support that escape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the solution to the Amazon Rain Forest problem,<br>also solves the suffering of almost all people pushed into addiction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will be able to move,<br>to try to start a new life, in a place they never knew existed, among people they didn't realize could love them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, you also solve most crime,<br>the will be no robberies in the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will collapse the Prison Industry,<br>again, the investors there, made a stupid bet, and they should stupidly lose everything - that's how you play the market game, it is the rule.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Of course, it is safe to say, that people who stand against Basic Income and Real Education,<br>are <strong>totally</strong> out of their f***ing minds, and you can, just, ignore, what they have to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact there is a name for making stupid arguments like that,<br>what they are doing should be called, verbal diarrhea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a similar condition,<br>is at the root of <span>Mass Incarceration<sup>[5]</sup></span> in United States.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now without further ado,<br>let me help you to see the beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Better sit down,for this one,<br>as this is basically the opposite of what you are told to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also won't make this an abrupt process,<br>that will stress you out - but a slow one that will give you the strength you need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stop memorizing, stop cramming before tests,<br>but for every class you fail, you need to learn a new talent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stuff like 3D Modeling and Printing, Making Electronic Circuits,<br>Programming, and programming single board computers and their pin boards to taste robotics...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning Digital Painting In Krita, or Graffiti Art with wall projectors,<br>even <span>Crossing great trails<sup>[6]</sup></span> and Survival Training.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is called a real education, learning things that move you,<br>that call to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Year after year, as you learn more and more, you begin learning faster and faster,<br>and somehow understand more and more of the world we live in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You transmute, Real Knowledge,<br>into Wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This transmutation,<br>only works with functional knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To use a car analogy,<br>a toy car can't get you across town.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, the text time yo are handed a test or pop quiz,<br>slowly begin imagining what will happen when you hand it in blank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just relax,<br>it does not have to be your first, or third, or even fifth test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just imagine,<br>rising.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when you are ready,<br>you hand it in blank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe use your power and growing wisdom,<br>to legibly scribble to your teacher some words of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't make enemies,<br>a lot of the fake teachers, would end up teaching for real, if they had strong Universal Income protecting them from... destruction, basically.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to team up with others,<br>keep an eye on the back row, but set the so called smart kids free, first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you are all suspended,<br>or put on some mad and scary academic suspension - organize, and stay in the news.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Give talks, stage walks,<br>hand out notes, get a microphone and tell everyone what they are already thinking, what they have been ready to hear forever and a half.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The schools have been <span>making a fool out you<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br><span>they are taking advantage of your lack of experience in a way you can't prove<sup>[8]</sup></span>, <span>the text books are a scam<sup>[9]</sup></span>, and you don't just need debt forgiveness, you need a fu***ng refund.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are staging a global protest against fake education,<br><span>fake education is a problem even the most brilliant of us haven't quite noticed yet<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with all movements,<br>you will need a common objective you can all converge on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is of course,<br>the real school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another warning, the fortunes of many institutions that have bet on the end of humanity are at stake here,<br>parasitic corporations and individuals will attack you with a might you, will, not, see coming, until it is too late.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will manipulate you with ideas,<br>that you will not be able to recognize in time, as false.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please, <strong>do not</strong> elect a leader,<br>as they will easily derail your movement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rule by the force of a massively multiplayer round table,<br>where only the voice of the brilliant many can speak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Speed thy,<br>slowly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must understand and employ the collaborative process behind Wikipedia,<br>and begin building a system similar to a <strong>game</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the first fun uses for it,<br>is having the Politicians that are in charge of your future play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not just to shame them,<br>the School Game is structured in a way that teaches them, how to play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By playing the game for a little bit,<br>they get a basic education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even a little bit of a real education,<br>makes them better at what they are supposed to be doing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By playing the game, they get a glimpse of the future,<br>and the consequences of their inactions, and small minded thinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They get to witness the impact of their flawed decision making,<br>on <strong>your</strong> existence <strong>and</strong> the well being of your Grand Children.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure, that there are multiple Open Source school systems in competition with one another,<br>and of course, that the winning one will get translations into all the languages, and that all people can access your school eventually.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The second fun use,<br>is witnessing how young people are much more perceptive and better at learning than we all assumed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps you can do something, to help the politicians to get ready to have their fat asses handed to them,<br>by foul mouthed twelve year old girls with a superior education - IDK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wish I had some proof for you,<br>but Improved Education, is the only road to Global Universal Income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a ladder, that the world climbs,<br>and gets higher powers from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Darkly speaking; either way, eventually people would see that there is no future,<br>when they desperately sell out their future generations, just to live their own life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In order for the world to begin healing,<br>poverty must end, for poverty to end, you have to build real schools so that the resulting politicians can see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hey, cheer up,<br>you are not alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moment you hand in your first blank test,<br>all the Great Beings in the world today, and even those who have already passed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stand by your side in kinship, friendship, appreciation of your courage,<br>and in the shared vision of a better future, that <strong>is</strong> worthy of us all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Cramming for tests, and pretending to learn, while everyone fills their pockets with your debts and savings -<br>was never the way forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you are not giving anything up,<br>by making your own, more authentic way, though Arts and Sciences.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You would have neither found Wisdom, nor Greatness, in the inauthentic path,<br>there was no authentic prestige there, no real graduations or diplomas, - the futures that are worthy of you are the ones that are most authentic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this idea needs you, we do our best thinking out on the very limits of our mental capacities and this is mine,<br>so take this idea and write, and imagine, and build, and continue until you reach your limits, though with a much finer version than the scraps you found here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like the better future,<br>your Unimaginable Greatness is well within your reach.</div>
