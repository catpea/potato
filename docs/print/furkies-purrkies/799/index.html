  <div class="paragraph">This is all between you<br>and me...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first time I saw the sea,<br>I muttered "are you freaking kidding me"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't speak English yet,<br>but we all have a way of saying it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt betrayed,<br>that this experience was delayed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was only about eight or so,<br>I was pretty smart, though.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At first glance I knew with certainty,<br>that I was the, son of the sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember walking the longest the peer,<br>with a grin and not a hint of fear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, and I remember the Baltic Sea; food,<br>being extremely good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The flounders on a pointy stick<br>were always extra salty and thick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have since visited the Atlantic Ocean,<br>even used a sandy New York Subway for locomotion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And found that I must do what it takes,<br>to live within a driving distance to Great Lakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, each year I cheerfully await Spring,<br>so that I may hear Seagulls sing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes I even buy sea shells at a local store,<br>to secretly scatter them at the lake Michigan shore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I call it it the varnished treasure,<br>and it never fails to make tourists happy beyond measure.</div>
