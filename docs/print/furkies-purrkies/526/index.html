  <div class="paragraph">I think, that we have to stop participating it passing on errors,<br>Poverty, Nuclear Weapons, Mass Incarceration, Police Brutality, War - are all errors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">None of this should make it into the next generation,<br>it is cruel to act as if Mass Incarceration is mistake that we just have to get used to - it isn't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very strange to witness politicians doing as little as possible,<br>and for us to just simply accept it as Bureaucracy or Politics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps it would be too much to ask of ourselves to fix all this,<br>after all we have inherited most of this mess ourselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But being vocal and intolerant of these errors,<br>should be our duty, to the younger generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In order to establish a way to communicate these complex ideas,<br>we must immediately cease to tolerate fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education is the root,<br>of all this evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Almost all of us have experienced fake education first hand,<br>the grades didn't matter, the lessons plans were incoherent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we were made to celebrate graduation,<br>with our heads full of disconnected facts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of people still don't know,<br>their education was fake.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One of the sickest things that comes out of that dog and pony show,<br>is students being tricked into thinking they are "just not that smart".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And some people take it a step further,<br>and never even try to read a book â€“ they just assume they are not into that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">For those of you who are right at the tipping point,<br>the book you are looking for is Short History Of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you want the Audio Book, the Narrated Version,<br>and don't stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first one-hundred books are extremely important,<br>they will help you catch up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to plow through a total of 10,000 books,<br>but the big milestones are at 100, 500, and 1,000.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is an education that leaves you with abilities that you frequently use,<br>either directly, or to build on, or by subtle analogy to something else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education teachers you to need common denominators,<br>real education shows you that it is a misunderstanding to just try to add fractions from different denominator worlds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers are doing such a terrible job,<br>they aren't explaining things in ways that are compatible with what we already know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And math class is for killing math,<br>the best class to learn real mathematics from is Programming and Generative Art.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">School is for learning thousands of useful things,<br>and loving it every day, there are no grades in real school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In real schools you create,<br>and the ability to make that creation, and keep it, and use it, is the reward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all got tricked,<br>and then sent to college to start paying for this nonsense.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Seth Shostak says that the way we can tell a Species is intelligent,<br>is whether or not they can make a radio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to know how to compose music, fix electronics,<br>how to program computers, how to use 3D printers, how to model 3D objects and characters - and how to make a radio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We weren't even taught how to draw,<br>all it takes is a photo and a projector, and then some pencils and blending stumps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It sounds silly to mention such simple things,<br>but this mode of thinking shows, that we have been robbed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we need to know of this robbery,<br><span>to finally put an end to it<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Preventing the emergence of Wisdom and Greatness,<br>in the minds of Human Beings has been tried before, and by the most evil of men.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It doesn't matter if we are doing this by accident, or by inheritance,<br>once we know we are propagating errors we must stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education must end right now,<br>that is the only thing that the younger generations need help with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will learn on their own,<br>they will fight tooth an nail on their own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They just need to know,<br>that they are being tricked, that they are being robbed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That their minds are traded,<br>for years and years of paychecks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That they are seen as a source of income,<br>by everyone involved in the education industry.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Education is not about just learning random disconnected facts,<br>that is just a circus trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education it is about a quest for knowledge,<br>a quest that that empowers us with great wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is about growing all the way up<br>until we become great beings who gift the future generations with meaningful and lasting contributions.</div>
