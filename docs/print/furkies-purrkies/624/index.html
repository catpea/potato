      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Little Observation About Music Composition</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have noticed that low pitched sounds are rare,<br>and high pitched sounds more frequent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a musical composition Bass Drums,<br>are a lot less frequent than cymbals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think this observation can be very valuable,<br>to people that just started learning music.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can get to the Beat+BassLine Editor in lmms,<br>you can start composing instantly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Put the drums on every beat,<br>or maybe every other beat....</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then whatever sounds higher,<br>make it more frequent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is one very very very tiny complication here,<br>we will immediately add variation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Find the clone steps button,<br>in the upper right corner of the Beat+BassLine Editor and hit it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now the patter you created will have twice the length,<br>so mess up the second part a very very very tiny bit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Allow me to demonstrate,<br>Normally, lmms starts in 140 beats per minute.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'll use the metronome to let you hear the beat,<br>at 140bpm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(metronome plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now let me put a drum on every other beat,<br>I'll keep the metronome on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(drum1 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, allow me to turn off the metronome,<br>so you can hear what every other beat sounds like without interference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(drum2 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you were to measure beats of this sample,<br><span>your tool would report 70 beats per minute, since we are skipping every other beat<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now let us put in a second drum,<br>filling in those empty beats, this will register as 140bpm now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(drum3 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this point you can hear how this has no motion or dance,<br>it seems very square, very mechanical.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, already we will perform that,<br>very very very tiny complication here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where we double things up,<br>and introduce gentle variation in the second part.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(drum4 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see how neat it sounds,<br>let me redo this one more time, to show you variation on the other drum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(drum5 plays)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though we are just doing two boring drums,<br>by adding that one variation...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is just an extra hit on the drum,<br>we get a melody going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By just hitting the drum one extra time,<br>we get a melody, out of nowhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I really hope you don't mind me adding that variation,<br>it is just a beautiful thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So what we have now is the low pitch sound,<br>or low frequency sound, or bass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Basically hitting on every beat,<br>not counting the little variation, which hits the drum twice in a beat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now we will add a medium pitched sound,<br>that hits more often then the drum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(mid1 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now let us add a second medium pitched sound,<br>to introduce more variation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(mid2 plays)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And now we will add some high pitched sounds,<br>clicks and sticks and the like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These will hit at a very high rate,<br>which means we should break-up repetition more frequently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we will very the pattern twice or thrice,<br>or whatever sounds good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us give that a listen,<br>and I made this section slightly longer as it sounds nice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(high1 plays)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I would like to show you one more trick,<br>here we have to go to FX Mixer, click Master, Add Effect, and add Plate 2x2 versatile plate re-verb.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reverb effects are magical, as they take a dry sound,<br>and give them wet thickness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will replay the previous melody,<br>but this time slowly turn up reverb by the time we reach the middle of the piece.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(high2 plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here is the <span>full song<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>enjoy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(full plays)</div>
