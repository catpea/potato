    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Albert Einstein once said,<br>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In context of education,<br>this quote hints on existence of invalid lectures, lectures that can't teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Think about your Math education,<br>because for almost everybody Math-class is an example of fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics is just as interesting as 3D modeling or Programming,<br>but when taught wrong - it isn't really taught at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">A school that relies on powerful educational games,<br>would have a library requiring several years of play (or learning).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The aim of all the games, self employment, entrepreneurship,<br>independence, and safety and security.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no teachers here,<br>the games replace the teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A singe game,<br>would hold a semester of lectures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students here are not timed, there are no grades,<br>they either graduate to the next one, or are not yet ready.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students who pass a game can make a lot of money,<br>by tutoring others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything and by that I mean, the entire future of Humanity,<br>depends on the knowledge of the student.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some stories are told by a narrator,<br>others invite us to experience adventures along <strong>with</strong> the hero of the story.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the difference between a classroom,<br>and an educational game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what cannot be explained easily in an interactive setting,<br>may just not be worthy of the student's time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will say that a lecture presented by a single teacher,<br>to multiple students, is the worst way to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A library of BEAUTIFUL educational computer games,<br>that any student can browse through in any order.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without ever being graded,<br>and without ever being timed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And going online to meet up with their friends,<br>from all around the world, is the best idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here Education, is a private and personal thing,<br>it is almost exactly like self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Today to examine the dimensions of fractals we have to hurry or pause the lecture<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>but with games, the puzzles are solved at the student's own pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here they can stay in a game about Fractals for weeks,<br>if it captures their attention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And from here they may progress further into mathematics,<br>here they will never be graded down for exploring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the magical things about these games,<br>is that their content can be expanded from the inside, like Wikipedia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, educational games that enable students to expand their intelligence,<br>don't really exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A number of puzzle games exist<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>but they are for the youngest of students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As far as I know, <span>Kerbal Space Program<sup>[3]</sup></span>, comes closest,<br>but it does not seem to emphasize enabling the student with the full comprehension of Orbital Dynamics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there are no games that gradually increase in complexity,<br>towards the subject of Orbital Dynamics, covering Mathematics and Physics along the way,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The nearest analogue to games,<br>are programming challenges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While that is also an amazing way to learn,<br>it is not a beautiful and life changing way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because programming languages cannot deliver the carefully crafted visuals,<br>that help with comprehension.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The games are like the <span>3Blue1Brown<sup>[4]</sup></span> Video Chanel,<br>but it is the player that is guided to comprehend, and not the narrator that explains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These games are interactive visualizations-and-laboratories of University level courses,<br>with an easy on-ramp, that most often will include prerequisite games.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This type of a school would be free and open to all,<br>many of the students would dedicate their time to expand the games inside out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A university level education that only calls for a desktop computer,<br>it would surely become one of the most meaningful global undertakings.</div>
