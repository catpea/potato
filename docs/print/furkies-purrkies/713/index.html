  <div class="paragraph">I worry that my first poem is not enough to announce that gateways to art,<br>have opened to all now - there are no more barriers left.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Maybe, probably,<br>it is the first thing everybody learns at the Art Academy - but they don't seem to share.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This isn't really tracing,<br>this is not color by number either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is something different,<br>it is a way to improve art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is away to bring everyone,<br>into art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is a launchpad,<br>and an amazing teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I couldn't even list the things,<br>I've learned in the past two days.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Could this have been a secret,<br>that nobody wanted to talk about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Artist do tell each other that copying,<br>is not art - and what an awful and toxic thing to say that is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Use the reference Images Tool,<br>to place your source photo over the entire canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Set the source photo opacity to one percent,<br>now your color picker will only ever return colors from the invisible reference image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the Color Picker,<br>in God Mode.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone,<br>is an artist now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know art is a billion things,<br>and that tracing is in fact art, and an expression of respect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know there are nincompoops out there,<br>that will say it is not art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe we should just tell them,<br>that their portraits are slightly crooked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, art is about sending a message,<br>and pointing at thing and calling it "not art", sends the wrong one.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This technique of always having the correct color<br>in the precise area of the canvas your brush is in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Means that you can paint photo realistic portraits,<br>you still choose the brush, or when you actually need the new color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You still take the portrait photo,<br>you still have to pay attention to the way the face is lit up by the sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you can make a caricature,<br>by using <span>GIMP's warp transform<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And other customization and arrangements,<br>along the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is no barrier here,<br>art is open to you now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are,<br>an artist.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is too easy to underestimate the significance of color being a click away,<br>relatively speaking transferring proportions or outlines is child's play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wrong proportions are easy to spot, and show first,<br>but it is the color that makes art beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In realistic portraits,<br>color is critical.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You are an artist" is all I can say in hopes of explaining<br>how important that invisible layer of color is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The barrier to enter art,<br>is gone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you paint your first digital painting,<br>the gateway of adding everything else is wide open.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything will call to you, enhanced realism with perfect eyes and faces radiating with sunshine,<br>backgrounds with fantastic creatures and universes, caricatures and lowbrow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An unlike color and proportions,<br>these enhancements are all friendly and full of joy, and extremely rewarding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only other thing I can say,<br>is that your paintings will look so real, people will have trouble believing it is not some clever trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that will serve as an invitation,<br>to teach them, to show them that gateways to great art are open now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are,<br>an artist.</div>
