    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The better the flow,<br>the easier the lessons go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Forced education - what a curse,<br>there is nothing worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the other hand,<br>learning and having fun is grand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are having fun,<br>learning is instantly done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to memorize anything,<br>you'll soon start squirting ideas like a wellspring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't learn in school under threat,<br>there is simply nothing to get.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are dreamers and inventors powered by joy,<br>school seem like a of ploy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what is happening,<br>being a real teacher is such beautiful thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until school starts teaching you for real,<br>and gets rid of grades - no deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn on your own first,<br>without real education you'll be cursed.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very easy to get going,<br>as all the fun is in knowing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn how to use leading Open Source programs,<br>and use lmms and <span>P5.js Audio<sup>[1]</sup></span> to <span>make some awesome jams<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is nothing like what we see in school,<br>it is more like reinventing art, science and every tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failing at something or making a mess,<br>is just as precious as progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Having fun while learning,<br>will have you keep returning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reading and listening to biographies and books,<br>will help you see all the crooks.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Feeling joy and having fun,<br>will also saturate everything you've done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because your heart is smiling,<br>as you are sculpting, painting, composing or compiling....</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The content of your works will be funny,<br>and will make every day sunny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all have great thirst for understanding,<br>and our minds have no limits as they are ever expanding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self education, as in putting real education first,<br>was what helped Newton, Bruno, and Leonardo to quench their thirst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they were all having fun,<br>it is how they became as brilliant as the sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let your joy flow into your work,<br>give each and every one of your works a funny quirk.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Put a lemur in an awkward place,<br>use it to mark your style or space.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or use only one shape in all your art<br>like Yayoi Kusama who is extremely smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or focus just on one area of mathematics,<br>and let it grow, with utterly useless robotics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never let go of having fun,<br>and <span>people will soon stand in awe of even the tiny things you have done<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fun will keep you reinventing, revisiting, and returning,<br>and that is what it means to be truly learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real education is begotten with ones own heart,<br>not by pretending that memorization makes us smart.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your mind is one of a kind,<br>and your unique constellation is perfectly aligned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the areas of your fun will eventually connect,<br>and all your creations will begin approaching perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you have to feel joy, and have fun,<br>you have to allow the energies of your life to run.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world needs your original, unique, or funny creations,<br>if you put joy in it you will be remembered for many generations.</div>
