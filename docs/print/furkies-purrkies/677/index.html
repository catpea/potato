    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a Philosopher,<br>is an important part of learning and growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you are certainly,<br>not supposed to wait for your golden age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Golden Age has it own wisdom,<br>the philosopher in you starts when you start.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Three are many heights to climb,<br>and you can pretty much feel when you reach a new height.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You rise up on a plateau,<br>wiser, stronger, more powerful, and with a greater clarity of vision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it happens without even trying,<br>merely rejecting the easier wrong and taking the harder right, elevates us.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Word of caution,<br>people who can't become Philosophers exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is not a permanent condition,<br>it is a mixture of unhealthy things that stand in their way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stress, overwork, servitude, following orders,<br>and making other people's lives easier.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And a simple test of this state, is,<br>can you enjoy an audio book?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to read it,<br>you just need to listen and flow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can't flow,<br>it means you got to pack for the <span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[1]</sup></span>, often.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just the philosopher in you that fails to grow,<br>but also Authenticity, Dignity, Class, Creativity, Compassion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And certainly Knowledge, Wisdom, and Love Of Life,<br>and of course your Greatness; that depends on all these lovely items.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is an extreme danger, because all the decisions you make in that state,<br>are mostly incompatible with who you really are, and by extension the elder you.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Philosophers, and the philosopher that you are meant to become,<br>are a force on the scale of the universe; A Universal Power.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Philosophers get to see the lies and the future,<br>they can see where the lairs are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And like a mother can tell when their baby is lying,<br>they can watch lies in real time as they unfold before them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see, when we are all allowed to grow up,<br>the liars have nowhere to hide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world,<br>corrects it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People connect,<br>across all borders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That you are meant to become a Philosopher on your way to growing all the way up,<br>is one of the most sacred things in the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a Philosopher, a Lover of Wisdom,<br>becomes the Keeper of Earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once we are allowed and encouraged to grow all the way up,<br>all the world problems will become repaired.</div>
