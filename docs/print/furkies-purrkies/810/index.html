  <div class="paragraph">People talk about Mr. Sagan,<br><span>predicting future<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others like me; want Mr. Vonnegut to return,<br>and I want Mr. Hitchens, and Sir Robinson, Mr. Bukowski, and Miss Rand to return too... somehow.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Life is too short,<br>to be this unfair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is not,<br>the right way to think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mr. Sagan reminds us,<br>that we too have responsibilities.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In the same way that Gaia exits,<br>where all organisms on earth can be poetically viewed as one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There also exists a voice, poetically speaking,<br>it has been called the spirit of our age, the Zeitgeist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I dare say Mr. Vonnegut would remind us that this is our age now,<br>not fake teachers, moron charlatans, dipsomaniacs, or childlike dictators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Gaia and the Zeitgeist are helping us to great poetry,<br>they are delivering to us what they have once granted to the Greats.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Gaia’s call,<br>was heard loud and clear by our generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the Zeitgeist is not as serious, I think it has always been in great part,<br>a treasure chest of very sophisticated humor waiting to be aired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is time for a new generation of writers,<br>to hear the Zeitgeist, to open this magnificent chest of yet unspeakable treasure.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It seems on the day the Congress of United States,<br>begun researching the fancy UFO/s.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though not before they tried to save face,<br>and in the last desperate second invented a new acronym UAP.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">UAP which secretly means:<br>Uneducated Asinine Politicians.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">DARPA begun studying the reason why fringe beliefs,<br>float to the top, so to speak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Similarly how <strong>they</strong> floated to the top of class,<br>by cramming, and tolerating fake education, never asking about the real deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And also the reason,<br>why they will study Twitter, and possibly Electolytes that plants crave.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And never detect, that their doctorates, and paychecks,<br>are fake, as fake as the education they received in the overpriced schools that made them into no less than a sausage.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This is a gold mine,<br>this is not a mere event but a phenomenon of some kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A wellspring of the snarkiest of snarky snarks,<br>countless books, and even more countless articles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And my gosh, I swear to goodness, your works will get published,<br>so fast that, faster than a UFO can soil a a politician’s legacy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You know, Vonnegut and Bukowski,<br>can’t handle this, it would be too beautiful for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They would want us to pick up where they left off,<br>they would want to read your works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Raw and radiant,<br>not yet made classy with age, but snarked snarkedy out of your very youth.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The Greatest Minds, would want you, you!<br>to pen the new snarky adventures of heroines and anti-heroes...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who today, sadly, to us tragically,<br>are only known to your heart or soul...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Locked in the Brilliance of your mind,<br>yet to be writ, in your wit.</div>
