    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Value or DARKENESS CONTROL, is in deed a thing,<br>especially once you start creating multi-character scenes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will have to make sure that all shadows,<br>match up, that hings are not too light here, and too washed out there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Color, is a similarly sized problem,<br>so both are formidable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some artists build their scenes out of of three values,<br>dark medium and light, and they stick with it like crazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A warrior that is close to you will have dark value,<br>the hero in the middle will have medium value, and dragon in the background is light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some will not insert anything between the three,<br>no beast, tree, or hero, it is a dead zone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would call it, a dead zone,<br>of artistic wisdom and excellence - quite brilliant.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Others may paint out some rough sketch that is value-stable,<br>and then almost smudge out characters and features out of that, upwards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As if they are rising from the ground,<br>also an amazing thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whether you use to those values in conjunction with a Color-mode layer,<br>where all your colors are stripped of their own value and inherit the values from beneath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or repeat the process with very strict color selection,<br>you will end up with a simple, clear, and stable value system throughout your masterpiece.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is something else,<br>a thing practiced by concept artists who are pushed to work at maximum speeds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will start with a blurry photo,<br>as a seed, a landscape of value and sometimes color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will still head towards establishing a strict system of light medium dark,<br>or smudge out, or pick out colors from a particular distance within the painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is going to be something really organic here,<br>a harmony of color that comes from reality, from the uni9verse it self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And starting with some blurry scrap of a photo,<br>also helps you visualize composition, you get a sturdy head start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This may not be the technique you end up using,<br>but it is a wonderful seed for your earliest works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just grab a corner of a photo, that has a pronounced light medium and dark value area,<br>adjust the color temperature, and build on top of it, whilst protecting value integrity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here your mid shadows, and light and dark shade,<br>will be on point, and sturdy as heck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bring in colors that are in harmony with those values,<br>and you will build out a strong color theme.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And composition, is not a question at all,<br>by starting with a blurry photo, you can map everything out from the start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get yourself a small inexpensive dedicated camera,<br>and begin collecting, colors, values, and compositions.</div>
