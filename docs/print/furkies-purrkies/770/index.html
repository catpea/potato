    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Two days of painting, two days of resting,<br>a new painting every four days, for about 75</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am only showing sixteen here,<br>because every time I look at <span>that damn Groundhog<sup>[1]</sup></span>, it snows.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t feel welcome in the art community,<br>and I got banned from one forum already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I said “That art teachers destroy artists,<br>and we have to fight them.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moderator said that the forum is owned by an art teacher,<br>and I will never post there again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though this is really funny,<br>I’ve decided to stand alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t have time to un-indoctrinate,<br>art students with a make believe education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is only time to help those who are curious about art,<br>to kick the other artists butts, on day one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In all seriousness, the fake pompous teacher problem,<br>is a horrible tragedy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, in their incompetence,<br>they turn people away from art, with boring things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what young students need,<br>is the instant ability...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To turn every freaking adult,<br>into a cute bobble head with shiny eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually,<br>I will release a series of pictorial tutorials.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no time for videos either,<br>strong info-graphics will do it, at least at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The art tutorials where students don’t have to practice drawing boxes,<br>and dive right into Impressionism, Hyperrealism and Realistic Pop Surrealism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And bobble heads,<br>because bobble heads, are Lyfe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will generate enough videos and related materials,<br>that all I need to do is invite the first few</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sixteen paintings, of which at least ten are very good.<br>may not seem like much in the world of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is everything in the world of Art Education,<br>in the world of real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is everything,<br>because it provides real results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And “Real Results”,<br>is the definition of real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I would like to note that there are no masterpieces here,<br>and explain that a master piece is a multi-character scene.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again Pop Surrealist that most supreme form of art,<br>is probably the fastest and best way to build one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a word, a masterpiece is a scene that permanently baffles the viewer,<br>majority of people that see it, simply never, forget, your painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By extension that also means,<br>that they will reach out to own a copy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A masterpiece,<br>has legs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, if I had to create a masterpiece today,<br>which is about 30 years too early.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would paint a painting that shows how to help the world advance,<br>beyond, poverty, climate dangers, armed conflicts and war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be a concept map to that remind us all,<br>that to grow up, means to grow all they way up, to become great beings.</div>
