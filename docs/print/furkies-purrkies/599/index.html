  <div class="paragraph">Teachers...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A negative grade,<br>does not provide aid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not motivate,<br>it prevents them from becoming great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Far too many teachers have confused students' intelligence,<br>with their own blind negligence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They say, students are getting dumber each generation,<br>but it was their task to provide the correct foundation.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Students...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell the teachers your minds are not for sale,<br>and let the teachers fail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fill the auditorium, the lunchroom and the library,<br>and learn, because life without real education will get scary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fight to learn to build small companies tooth and nail,<br>and fill them with products for sale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The philosophers are not warped or crazy,<br>it was that the teachers were always too lazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Socrates should mark the beginning of your quest,<br>listen to every philosopher all they way up to Cornel West.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Build a memory palace or maybe a cathedral, or a city even,<br>built something you can trust and believe in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Build in sequence that history dictates,<br>this will help you remember all the Philosophers and True Saints.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never again trust others with the content of your character and mind,<br>precisely because of every one of those paychecks that they signed.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And people of the world...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to be done with the old,<br>we need to stop doing what we are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is time to take to wisdom and think,<br>this world is not yours as you are but a chain link.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are an important connection to the future,<br>not a temporary means for some moocher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You were meant to be protectors of all the living creatures,<br>but you got sold out, by the teachers.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Yes, repeated mistakes show you forgot much,<br>but you have to regain that touch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no one listening to you above,<br>you are to gift the future generations with unconditional respect and love.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the future that listened to your thoughts all along,<br>they hear everything and always forgive you for being wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they need you to get up each and every time,<br>they don't want a future filled with collapsing ecosystems and crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need you to become wise,<br>so that politics and ecosystems have a hope to stabilize.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not our first rodeo, folks,<br>and climate change is not a hoax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to end poverty, prisons, and wars,<br>we have to relax borders and open doors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hating or being scared of our family is a sickness,<br>that a wise nation will erase with great quickness.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">War is never the solution,<br>and it invalidates every participating institution.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Remember, all the people with eyes you do not recognize,<br>are just your sons and daughters in disguise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The division,<br>is made out of lack of vision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people of the world,<br>need to help the children before they become too old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prevention! It is best to prevent division,<br>and only wisdom can provide the needed cohesion.</div>
