      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">This Poem Is Not For Students</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Truth and authenticity,<br>are a pre-requisite for Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your children must become Great Beings,<br>with Authenticity, Wisdom, and their Uniqueness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Public schools are a new invention,<br>they are no longer moving towards education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have been made into a processing plant,<br>an institution where everyone gets paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The who, thing, that derailed schools,<br>is us, from students on up, inclusive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When students tolerate education they know is fake,<br>to be obedient, to be like others, to not to question.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They only oil this machine,<br>they are the fuel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For me the symbol of fake education,<br>is the wall projector in the art class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher will brainlessly repeat,<br>some nonsense about Baroque.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the students will just sit there,<br>memorizing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they used the projector to project their selfies,<br>and created realistic drawings and paintings of each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually they would naturally,<br>reinvent the Baroque style of expression and decoration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But instead what they get is a teacher,<br>who is hardly present.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Going full auto,<br>until work is over.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The loans are a scam,<br>any commercial software being taught is a scam.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When Profiteering Gluttons concoct the idea of loans for Teenagers,<br>with the little quirk, of being unforgivable by bankruptcy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means school is over,<br>and self education must take over.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your children will be subjected to even more brainless lectures,<br>as teachers are replaced with videos that can’t ever beat a valuable book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, spying on the students in any way is unethical and harmful,<br>it is a betrayal of the worst kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eye tracking during tests is especially harmful and demeaning,<br>this is not how we are to treat our students, this is a disgusting betrayal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because to keep making money,<br>curriculum must be created, and wisdom and foresight be damed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Closed software is forcing your child to become a customer,<br>it is an insult to you, to your children, and to your children future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time they reach High School they should be abble to write simple programs,<br>paint digital portraits, and sculpt and model 3D objects along with being able to edit video and audio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Linux, ECMAScript and nodejs, Krita and Gimp, Blender and Audacity,<br>are a must, because these technologies can set your child from poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something that loans,<br>can’t do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this is not a letter about High School,<br>this is about what High School will do to your child’s mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will use drugs to self medicate the stress of fake school away,<br>in some cases a doctor will prescribe similar rugs, to keep them still and memorizing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memorization is not education, remembering πr2 is cute,<br>but you need to be <span>able to draw a circle<sup>[1]</sup></span> on a <span>computer screen<sup>[2]</sup></span> out of pixels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">John Krakauer wrote about how bad lack of real upbringing, lack of real education,<br>and a complete misunderstanding of reality, really gets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The carrot and stick of Loans and Fake Education,<br>can probably go up to a million dollars or more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The job, will almost certainly not match inflation,<br>and pay as little as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unforgivable loans means that that money will be taken out of their paychecks,<br>for as long as they live.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is very bad for their mental health,<br>for their self esteem.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, that is still not quite what I wanted to say,<br>it is best said with quotes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I want you to know these are horrible quotes,<br>they are burdensome quotes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that they are questions,<br>that you need to explain to your child.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because you are not allowed,<br>to put them in a situation...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where they come back home from college,<br>with tens of thousands of dollars in college loan and credit card debt...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With fake education, an education so ineffective,<br>that they wouldn't know a Philosopher from a Liar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So ineffective, that they would have learned a hundred thousand times more,<br>if you just help them navigate their noblest curiosities all around the world.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Henry Thoreau<br>American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Kurt Vonnegut<br>One Of Our Most Beloved Writers</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So, in the interests of survival, they trained themselves to be agreeing machines instead of thinking machines. All their minds had to do was to discover what other people were thinking, and then they thought that, too."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Your parents were fighting machines and self-pitying machines. Your mother was programmed to bawl out your father for being a defective moneymaking machine, and your father was programmed to bawl out your mother for being a defective housekeeping machine. They were programmed to bawl each other out for being defective loving machines. Then your father was programmed to stomp out of the house and slam the door. This automatically turned your mother into a weeping machine. And your father would go down to the tavern where he would get drunk with some other drinking machines. Then all the drinking machines would go to a whorehouse and rent fucking machines. And then your father would drag himself home to become an apologizing machine. And your mother would become a very slow forgiving machine."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Here was what Kilgore Trout cried out to me in my father's voice: "Make me young, make me young, make me young!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Charles Bukowski,<br>One of Our Greatest Poets</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?"</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And my quote,<br>I, am the absolutely worst of all writers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not allowed to deny them<br>Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness in any way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is their world now,<br>it is <strong>their</strong> future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will close with a Poem, that we should have read in a wiser, peaceful today,<br>instead of these terrible quotes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A poem that is worthy of us,<br>and that we are worthy of.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Kosmos, by Walt Whitman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</div>
