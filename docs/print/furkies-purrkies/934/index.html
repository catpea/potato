  <div class="paragraph">Exercise is easy and there are things that we can learn on our own,<br>for example jogging will give a person larger leg muscles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a way all the world’s joggers are running a massive experiment for you,<br>results of which you can see with our own eyes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Rather than listening to a trainer that says,<br>oh lift this way, that will quickly fill up your shoulder muscles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who may have no idea what he is talking about,<br>or how long it would take, and how long the exercise must last.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Listen or look at athletes,<br>that look the way you want to look, see what they are up to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their routine presents clear evidence,<br>that gets you from beginning to where you need to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And their workouts seem hard, because they have increased their endurance,<br>they didn’t start working out the way they train today.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You don’t have to jog, bicycle or swim, if you don't like any of it,<br>you can find something similar like <span>dancing<sup>[1]</sup></span>, or <span>hiking<sup>[2]</sup></span> long distanced with a hefty backpack.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ad if you want bigger shoulders, for example, then dance with dumbbells,<br>that is what gyms are for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don’t get discouraged, know that you have to earn your endurance,<br>by slowly increasing the level of your workout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more meaningful your workout,<br>the more easily your body will understand your needs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lift or carry your weights in a way that does not make you stop,<br>keep them at such a weight, that always allows you to continue your workout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And continue, to push the limits of your endurance,<br>increasing your endurance is critical to transform your body.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Finally stay safe, don’t bicycle on roads at night, don’t run when your feet are injured,<br>protect your back, hydrate, and don’t lift heavy, as that only increases chances of injury.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no shortcuts where it comes to taking care of yourself,<br>you away take the long road, the life long road, and the most beautiful road.</div>
