      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of Constellations, Superluminal Galaxies, And The Future Of Humanity</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps our consciousness,<br>comes from a copy of our talent for navigation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hence the constellations,<br>there are places that we must visit in out thoughts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the early ones is why are we here?,<br>we are an <span>emergent<sup>[1]</sup></span> element of the infinitely complex universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We come from an infinite number of experiments,<br>in what we call the fields of Physics and Chemistry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The universe has been mixing it self for so long,<br>that we had no choice but to exist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another star,<br>symbolizes the question of meaning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What is the meaning of life?<br>it is to flourish in our our powers, talents, and miracles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In all the things that are the noblest, the highest,<br>and all too human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One particularly lonesome stars,<br>begs the question of what happens, after.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>We are made of stardust<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>elements put here by stars that burst their contents into space.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The atoms that coalesced to make our bodies,<br>will go on to become parts of other things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And our minds will return to the silence,<br>that we all have our origins in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Consciousness is one of the miracles of Life,<br>it is like a star.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And another star marks the question of whether or no there are others,<br>yes, many others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The universe will never stop in its experiments,<br>in the vastness of space and time there are and will be infinite others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are a drop in an infinite ocean,<br>and we are somewhat lonely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Light maybe fast for us, but in cosmos speed of light is extremely slow<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>it takes a long time to travel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the light we can see in the sky,<br>took a long time to reach us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are seeing photos of the past,<br>and galaxies 16 billion light years away maybe beyond our reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>They are moving at a super-luminal speed<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>faster than light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure that merely knowing,<br>that there are galaxies beyond our observable universe, will help dream of ways to get there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life does not happen frequently enough for us to pickup their radio signals,<br>and they will always broadcast them in search of others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And life does not happen all at the same time,<br>in the vastness of time technologically advanced life transforms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Throughout history there have been numerous attempts,<br>to dim our shining questions, and in all cases for petty reasons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To prolong the life of long forgotten kingdom,<br><span>or the memory of some king<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To collect coin, a little from a lot,<br>is even more than a lot from a few.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To dominate,<br>and create a workforce.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And today,<br>to put food on the table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rather then setting aims,<br>we have taken to amending that which belongs to the past.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the old conspires to restrict our questions,<br>the world slows down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">War is a terrible and old idea,<br>we can clearly see all the places that need good schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can all imagine how student exchange,<br>could improve the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are held back by borders,<br>that aren't really for Human Beings anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With the use of computers,<br>we can end poverty in an instance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fear of hunger and homelessness,<br>does not belong in the modern world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nor does punishing those who have already been punished,<br>by keeping criminals, Human Beings, in cages.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is not up to a police officer to take a life,<br>only a doctor can make that decision.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When unraveled and aligned in a proper sequence,<br>the problems we face today prevent one anther from emerging.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fixing schools also repairs Politics,<br>enabling the existence of World Wide Universal Income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The end of poverty marks an end of most crime,<br>revealing that it is therapy, medicine, and more beginnings that law breakers need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With real schools, wisdom in politics, and a compassionate and understanding world,<br>all kinds of borders will cease to have a meaning, and most wars and conflicts will fade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wars were never meant to be fought as they only mark defeat in their misery,<br>wars are meant to to be prevented.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And prevention is just a matter of education,<br>expanding horizons, leaving bad ideas behind, experiencing a better part of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who have been forced into fake education,<br>do not understand that immigration is a form of preventing conflict and later war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some are so stressed and misguided,<br>that they may not have the capacity to care about the world of their grandchildren.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wage slavery, credit scores, imaginary education, imaginary borders,<br>cages for people fractured by poverty that the world did nothing to prevent, is not who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have enough to help people all around the world to get a fine education from meaningful audio books and video lectures,<br>an education that helps us come together as one peaceful family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The future that Humanity needs, begins with the creation of schools that change lives,<br>schools that help people see in their wisdom and greatness, that Human Beings are a family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to see ideas in time,<br>and become artists at picking the good ones from bad ones apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For Humanity to advance,<br>we have to learn to leave all the bad ideas behind, and teach to prevent their repetition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No more temporary things,<br>to make a faded chapter a thousand years from now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of schools that do Humanity justice; we have to take to books,<br>we, must take the responsibility for our own education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To start, let us take to our constellations and lavish daydreams,<br>so that we can see that we are one, one Human Family under the sun.</div>
