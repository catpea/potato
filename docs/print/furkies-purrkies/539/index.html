  <div class="paragraph">When I was little, <span>I've noticed a couple of big trees on a hill<sup>[1]</sup></span> that as far as I knew;<br>could have been a mountain of some kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was way to far to even think about going there,<br>but it was nice to look at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd wake up in the morning,<br>and not having anything better to do, I'd look over yonder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After quite some time,<br>when I became older, ten or so.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I realized,<br>I could just probably just go there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I prepared a small expedition,<br>and begun my trek.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Barely did I wonder off,<br>that I discovered Mice, Bunnies, Deer, and maybe even Wild Boar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had my knives with me,<br>as I was an avid collector.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I brought my Binoculars<br>and a Russian Monocular to even get a closer look at things, just in case there was interesting trouble.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had to bring provisions with me,<br>my drink of choice was Kompot, a tart old man's drink - fruit juice, but it was powerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And little sandwiches, and some pierogies,<br>as grand ma wouldn't let me leave without food - it was an extreme adventure - especially for little person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also had bacon bits with me,<br>they wqere called the skwarki.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The walk took forever,<br>most of the day it seemed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had my first breakfast alone, and lunch though I didn't know the word at the time,<br>and elevenses - always - and a break at noon, and sipped my kompot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often I would stop and sit at the side of the road,<br>trying to figure out what I am doing with my life, and how am I going to get to America.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Right as I was getting close to what definitely looked like a mountain,<br>tuned out I was right all those years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I discovered that there was a river there,<br>like a castle moat it stood between me and the mountain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember that in desperation, I started walking by the river, in search of a fallen tree or something,<br>but then ended up madly jumping across a narrow spot - and not unlike a flying squirrel would - landing on my stomach with a thud that kicked up a handful of dust.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other end, I discovered that I had to cross a wheat field,<br>it was pretty scary, cause anything could have been hiding there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was told that if a Wild Boar attacked,<br>I needed to climb a tree, but from where <strong>I</strong> was standing... the boar would be between me an the tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I had a pointy stick with me,<br>as far as first adventures go - you just don't know.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When I made it to the trees,<br>I immediately named them as Rain Makers, or Deszczowce.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they quickly became my friends,<br>and my first Fortress of Solitude.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They kept me dry from rain, provided plenty of sticks for miniature bonfires,<br>and kept me company in first big thoughts about the world.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was my original adventure,<br>the one that showed me that I am unstoppable, I can even jump rivers if necessary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All my earliest adventures were seriously Mighty,<br>I started learning English from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and German from Rosanne on German TV.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I saw a person type commands into a Commodore 64 computer, to start a game, I didn't even notice when the game started,<br>shortly thereafter Informatyka Class teacher accused me of cheating and copying homework - but even my bullies knew I wrote the program myself - that failing grade was my best grade ever.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I have measured the distance to my original adventure with modem tools just now,<br>and both to and from added up together come to a whopping 2.03 miles, or 3.26 kilometers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was very far for me, still is,<br>with all kinds of adventure gear, lots of food, and a large glass bottle of kompot, all manners of knives, and an angry pointy stick</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every great journey,<br>stars with that first defiant step forward - and maybe a a bottle of kompot, and some pierogies with skwarkis.</div>
