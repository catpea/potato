  <div class="paragraph">I remember the first time I saw a possum,<br>I was in US for a few years, but I' haven't seen one until I was in my mid 20's.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was sure that it was an enormous mutated rat,<br>it was on the other side of the road, and I was worried that it would go after me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are the size of a small mini-horse,<br>and that can be terrifying, at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they are very sweet,<br>and good for the neighborhood, they are a blessing as they eat tics, like a lot of them.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It took many years to encounter a skunk as well,<br>but as you can imagine, I was able to smell them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time I finally met one in person,<br>it was right next to me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was on his way,<br>going about his business, completely unafraid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The same can't be said for me,<br>by now I've lost count how many hot flashes I experienced in my life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you find yourself next to a wild animal,<br>the last thing you want to do is run away, as it may squirt after you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the stories I've heard,<br>no one really recovers from the squirt of a skunk, that smell stays with the victim for life.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I know that this is no big deal for people born in America,<br>but most of what I knew where I came from, were Well Traveled Pigeons, Fancy Squirrels, and Cute Sparrows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Storks, I don't even mention them,<br>as I basically grew up among them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were Deer, Wild Boar, Rabbits,<br>and Horses, Cows, Chickens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But animals in America are different somehow,<br>they seem more intelligent.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Aside from a terrible owl encounter,<br>and an <span>equally terrible poem<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did actually run into a creature that is rare,<br>and it was a very large porcupine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was on my way to the local store,<br>and it crossed the road, this was in the middle of the woods.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I didn't want to frighten it, I really wanted to take a closer look,<br>but all I got was a blurry photo as she hurried along her way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I didn't get a very good look,<br>the encounter seemed pretty magical.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I later found out that <span>Black Bears were being introduced, back into that area of the woods<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>but from what I understand they pretty much keep to themselves, unless they are trying to be cute.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Black bears don't run up to attack,<br>they just challenge people who are in their way, if you stand your ground they'll move along.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They seem to be just big raccoon,<br>brown bears are the scary ones.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I have had several close Raccoon encounters,<br>and they never cease to surprise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once at <span>Jackpine Hike-In Campgrounds<sup>[3]</sup></span> I woke up 4AM,<br>to a Raccoon , that I later named Friday, gently pulling out hot dog buns from my food pack.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did hang it up in the tree to be careful,<br>and it was in a zipped backpack, but there was a hole where the straps ran, and he found it, the little thief.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even since, I have started dangling my food from a branch on a rope,<br>that seems to present a proper challenge for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Over at <span>Nordhouse<sup>[4]</sup></span> I only ever encountered one Raccoon snooping around my tent,<br>this was some ways from the lake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am always very careful, to zip my tent before I go on a walk, or in this case a swim,<br>but this amazing brainic, unzipped my tent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It went inside and left paw prints on my pillow,<br>I have not used my inflatable pillow since.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I offer this advice to all adventurers,<br>bears or no bears don't keep food anywhere near your tent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And get a little luggage lock,<br>to lock the two zipper-pulls together when you go for a walkabout.</div>
