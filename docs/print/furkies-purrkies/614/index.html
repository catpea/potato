      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Full Of Stars</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poetically speaking our minds are full of stars,<br>the stars represent things that hold some kind if a meaning for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unique curiosities that we each have,<br>are just that kind of thing, a star.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be some gravity around it,<br>and we will be gently pulled towards it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Neat examples of curiosities are:<br>computers, real mathematics, 3D modeling, and music composition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From time to time stars will connect,<br>creating a greater constellation of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The connections are never feeble,<br>they are thick with ideas, lessons, thoughts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time I was looking over Dubstep,<br>which is very difficult to dance to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I saw skrillex using a grid of buttons to control music,<br>and while I misunderstood what he was doing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I understood how music can be made with a grid of on/off switches,<br>by remembering how player pianos used paper with holes to make music.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I created a test program I named <span>cylinder<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and it sure made some noise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The device that skrillex was using,<br>is called a <span>launchpad<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what it does is play music clips,<br>that are perfectly synchronized together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is probably just a customized computer keyboard,<br>designed for the software skrillex is using.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can see a software version,<br>on the front pafe of the <span>Learning Music Tutorial<sup>[3]</sup></span> at abelton.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But what I grasped in that moment,<br>was a different device called a <span>Beat Sequencer<sup>[4]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visit <span>Music Lab on Chrome Experiemnts<sup>[5]</sup></span> and click on,<br><span>Song Maker<sup>[6]</sup></span> to see one in action.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I downloaded <span>LMMS<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>and started poking at the <span>Bassline Editor<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And I continue making silly songs, I made one just a couple of days ago<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>there are no rules you just make noise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I started with a music star,<br>a curiosity about music composition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for a long time it just sat there twinkling,<br>until I wanted to see why everyone hated dubstep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And noticed that clip launchpad,<br>I made a connection from curiosity about music composition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To how a piece of software could function like a player piano,<br>and later, I started using lmms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This connection connects two of my stars,<br>curiosity about music, and interest in computers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another connection I made, started with me looking at a program called Blender,<br>which promised to teach 3D modeling with a <span>doughnut tutorial<sup>[10]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once I saw how easy it was I started modeling 3D objects,<br>for <span>3D printing<sup>[11]</sup></span>, mastering that in the process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I begun learning about Jewelry making which is not very difficult<sup>[12]</sup></span>,<br>but then discovered I can make screws that work like the real thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I became completely enchanted,<br>by the ability to make extremely complex things with the use of screws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had to stop and think about something else,<br>which became <span>Vector Mathematics<sup>[13]</sup></span> and <span>train hopping<sup>[14]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anyhow, the two stars connecting together,<br>in my constellation of art...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is 3D printing and 3D modeling,<br>I think this is the most beautiful connection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As it allows me to create real world objects,<br>from my imagination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not everything requires computers,<br>but computers are like a microscope that helps you get into things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If programming is one of your stars, perhaps it is time,<br><span>to slowly go over a JavaScript video tutorial<sup>[15]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Outside of computers, <span>I connected Projectors to Canvas<sup>[16]</sup></span>,<br>which allowed me to stop worrying about proportions and just focus on color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While painting is my favorite thing,<br>I also like sculpting with air dry clay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I understood a bit about sculpture by visiting an <span>Auguste Rodin<sup>[17]</sup></span> exhibit at the DIA,<br>it is hard to describe correctly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But to show a delicate touch, you sculpt a lady's hand arched back,<br>to show hard working hands, make them bigger, thicker, powerful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever the constellation, there are always plenty of stars,<br>so as long as they are your own you can't go wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be mindful and cautious when schools or parents push you into careers with dark skies,<br>but if you ever find your self lost, take to the trails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grand trails like the <span>Appalachian Trail of the East<sup>[18]</sup></span>, or the <span>Pacific Crest Trail of the West<sup>[19]</sup></span>,<br>they will help you find your way back under the starry skies.</div>
