    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Institutions are interested in numbers,<br>as they can easily argue that extreme abstractions and fantasies hold real data.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be tricked,<br>do not allow yourself to be manipulated by people who do not care about your education, but only their creepy abstract numbers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are only interested in teaching the maximum number of students,<br>as little as they can get away with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are successfully tricked to learn very little,<br>you will still be very smart, but easy to mislead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Vaccine hesitancy has its roots in being taught very little,<br>but still having a powerful intellect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People sense that they have been tricked,<br>and they start hesitating with everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They sense that trickery is at play,<br>from poverty, increasing prices, meaningless wars, and do-as-little-as-you-can politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe rare that a person that senses that they were mislead,<br>hesitates with just one thing, they hesitate with everything they are asked or forced to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, lack of knowledge which comes from ineffective or fake scrolls,<br>places things like UFO/s and angels, creepy religions and their armageddons, on par with fact and science - but, it is not quite their fault.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their teachers used them, for paychecks,<br>by cornering them with un-integrated knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Forcing them into thinking that they can game the educational system,<br>by memorizing for tests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is how being manipulated works,<br>we can kind of sense it, but we can't detect it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a massive wall that puts on a convincing educational show,<br>with tasty raisins like the deans list, diplomas, graduations, promises of a great job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the while teaching as little as possible to as many as they can,<br>while taking the maximum amount of money for tuition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not just cash fees, but loans,<br>and not standard loans, but loans that cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a system that was designed,<br>it was grown the way slime mold grows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A little bit at a time,<br>preferring the places that bring the most value.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So dumbing down of education,<br>and increasing tuition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then holding up outliers as evidence of success,<br>all those 4 students that went on to work for CERN.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or that one girl that had perfect grades,<br>though <span>not all Valedictorians allow themselves to be used this way<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When cornered,<br>the principals would say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to teach all the students a curriculum that is relevant to them,<br>so we only teach a curriculum that benefits the most.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the principal became more enlightened by the damage schools cause,<br>for example with grades where students become silenced by being tricked into thinking they are not as intelligent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If principals were shown that memorization is not in fact an education but a charade,<br>a charade that causes life long damage by trading functional and relevant knowledge for disconnected and irrelevant facts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The principals, the deans, would then utter, that terrible whimper;<br>"How were we supposed to know?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You intelligence is as sacred as your happiness, and as sacred as your heart and imagination,<br>as your spirit and creativity, and well being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may not submit your intelligence,<br>to any institution or teacher for any kind of evaluation or grading, or degrading as the case is today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to learn from books that changer lives, and help humanity grow,<br>works celebrated by the most knowledgeable and wisest of Humanity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not be graded down,<br>you are meant to be growing up, all the way up, walking an authentic road or real knowledge, until you too make lasting contributions to Human kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sorry to be the one to deliver this message,<br>but if you are a somewhere around middle school or high school... you are almost certainly being manipulated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher that is making you feel unintelligent,<br>is only doing that to keep you quiet, so that she or he can get paid with the least amount of effort.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She is forcing everyone to memorize,<br>that is not an education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't bother arguing with them,<br>if you make your point, then the teacher will go crying to a principal, and one of you will be reassigned to another class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tears will be real,<br>she is poor an you are cornering her, and messing with the food that she needs to put food on the table to feed her kids.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best that the principal can do for you,<br>is to feed you the Genius myth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you are exceptional, extremely intelligent, that the whatever need you,<br>that you should grow and learn, that too is a way to keep you quiet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some of the kids that graduate with high grades from prestigious universities,<br><span>temporarily and thus uselessly enhance their memory, prior to finals<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake or ineffective education is such a corrupting force,<br>that for some it will translate to a lifetime of addiction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think there a re people out there who have been promised a way to fix education,<br>only to be pushed down this dark, sometimes one way road.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These kids were not born addicts, and they would not become addicts if schools worked,<br>they were pushed into it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Addiction is not just about the drug,<br>but the inability to part with the lifestyle that the drug facilitates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why people say,<br>you need to change your lifestyle to get out of this hole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is because the lifestyle,<br>becomes a powerful force behind the addiction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A fake education and lack of knowledge,<br>will continue corrupting a person throughout their life, to keep the job, or the title, or impress friends or family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again, folks who end up down this path are not born this way,<br>they are pressured by fake or ineffective education to go down this path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And drugs will not actually give them a real education,<br>just a fake GPA and diploma, from - what is from their perspective - an utterly fake educational experience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Colleges and Universities, including the brand name ones,<br>will ignore this, if they can get away with it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because not just selling out students, but turning them into drug users,<br>makes them look great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some schools will encourage low performing students,<br>to get <span>treated for a disorder they don't have, with drugs that will improve their GPA<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">None of this is education,<br>and all of it is temporary, and some of it is temporary in the worst way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It it not possible to fake an education,<br>not is it possible to get it the moment you need it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to begin learning on your own,<br>in a sequence that matches your curiosity and existing knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And at a pace and time of day,<br>that fits you best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make your way to what moves you,<br>and begin there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But do not abandon your classmates,<br><span>learn about the mistakes of fake, or ineffective education, and help others by standing up and speaking out for them and the truth<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you come under attack,<br>you have an opportunity to use the force against you, to rise, and become a great being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the kids in the back,<br>they may not even know that everyone is memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know that whether you rise to speak out in lunch rooms or auditoriums, or later in life,<br>real knowledge is your right, and it will take you to wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In your wisdom, sooner than later,<br>you will see that we are each meant to become a great being - it is all to human.</div>
