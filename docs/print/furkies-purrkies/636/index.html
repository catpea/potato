  <div class="paragraph">Learning is an art,<br>so as long as we learn bit by bit we will become smart.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In schools teachers threaten to memorize,<br>but you should always aim to become wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to understand,<br>because you get nothing if you just perform and pretend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to learn huge lessons just a tiny bit,<br>you should aim just to sharpen your wit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We walk away from a school class with a test,<br>but learning for real is best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We won't always understand everything at once,<br>because we have to give ourselves a chance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You shouldn't aim to compose entire songs,<br>learn about drums and where the back-beat belongs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need to know how physics works for circuit design,<br>using a program to design your circuit and measure your voltages is fine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The need to sketch freehand to become an artist is dumb,<br>use a projector and keep having fun.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, you will not become a master of all while learning bit by bit,<br>but with each step you will enhance your mental toolkit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just because you know only a little about music composition,<br>and can't compose like a wold famous musician...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Does not make you worse,<br>not knowing the whole thing is not a curse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is one of the things that make you beautiful,<br>it simply means you are expanding your mind tool by tool.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When those who crammed for tests say you are Jack of all trades, and a master of none,<br>just tell them at least you are having fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the truth of the matter is that you are learning for real,<br>and they frequently pretend to be a big deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to learn for real is bit by bit,<br>and that's the only way anybody can make it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Merely passing tests makes a student hollow,<br>but learning for real makes a know it all.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That our curiosities branch in a few hundred directions,<br>means that we can make beautiful connections.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being a master of none while learning for real,<br>makes you beautiful, it <strong>is</strong> a big deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Believe me when I say,<br>that all your unfinished works are precious as they show your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They tell a history of who you are,<br>they show the path you took to become a star.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Drums have begun calling to me,<br>as <span>I danced to a Scottish song for everyone to see<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My dancing and curiosity about music are are merging,<br>and soon something new will be emerging.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am already learning to give my drums an upgrade,<br>let me show you an incomplete song I just made.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know how to fix it yet,<br>but I know once I discover it, I will never forget.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All my dance songs have thus far been incomplete this way,<br>but I'll learn how to do it right, someday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just because I am not a master,<br>does not mean this is a disaster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am just learning for real,<br>and I know that eventually all my songs will have great appeal.</div>
