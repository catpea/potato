  <div class="paragraph">Please no more war,<br>no more imaginary borders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty makes it hard to see,<br>and not everybody notices.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you were born to a different place,<br>your religion, intelligence, and level of safety would change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those things that change,<br>when you are born elsewhere, or elsewhen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are not who you are,<br>they have been impressed upon you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our brains love,<br>to accept the surrounding culture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Historically, genes of the rebels,<br>never got far.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Though the road Humanity walks,<br>was not made by followers...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It <em>was</em> made by those who accept,<br>contradictions, it is not the best road.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty is evil,<br>war is a crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Scientists are being ignored,<br>and liars effortlessly out-compete the honest in politics.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is an immature road,<br>we walk on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For all the wars,<br>we have fought it already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not excusable,<br>be we must keep learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just got here,<br>we just started putting the world together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Young civilization,<br>young species.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no emphasis,<br>on a global end to poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No emphasis,<br>on effective education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And nothing about,<br>growing all the way up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In poverty minds,<br>get compressed, and damaged.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When people fracture, color of skin, some made up god,<br>religions, other fantasies, or even their own damn bloodline...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Becomes an imaginary mark of superiority,<br>and thus division.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To feel special, worship Peace,<br>or a Growing Humanity...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To feel spiritual,<br>learn and write to help those who have fallen behind, or are yet to come.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To feel special seek Reason, Knowledge,<br>Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can become a Poet, a Philosopher, an Artist, a Musician,<br>and that on top of being a knowledge seeker, which is already special.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But do not take to fantasy,<br>Thoreau called it living deeply, and putting to route that with was not life.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Donâ€™t just lay there at the very bottom,<br>fantasizing how unique or special your random traits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty of mind and wallet is corroding and destroying everything,<br>the way to put an end to that is not found in imagination but courage and dignity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rise to become a Great Being,<br>start with Narrated Books, end with Noble Great Deeds that add to keep the world safe.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It needs to be repeated,<br>that if we are born to different religion...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We begin seeing gods that are other to that religion,<br>as inferior or imaginary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dawkins says that since we are atheist to all the other gods,<br>we might as well take one more step, and stop fantasizing, and start learning.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">What he means to say deep down,<br>is that imaginary divisions are hurting us, all of us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He is trying to show how silly the belief in something is,<br>when it is merely based on where we are born.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By subtle analogy,<br>we must take this lesson about beliefs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And apply it to other things,<br>that are dividing the world.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Innate human greatness,<br>cannot be applied externally by any means.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has to come from a wish to stand tall,<br>to stand complete, at our very best, at the highest mountains we reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That can only start,<br>by taking to books and wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As human beings we have the responsibility to understand that,<br>that we are one, one family, one blood, and in desperate need of real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wars must be prevented,<br>decades ahead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For that we need meaningful wisdom,<br>and a culture that helps the children to understand...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That meaning of life is found,<br>in growing all the way up with the aim to become great beings.</div>
