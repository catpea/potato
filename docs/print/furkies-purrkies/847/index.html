      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Drawing Tutorial; Or, A World Tricked Out Of Learning Art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Drawing it self is very simple,<br>because you begin your practice by means of direct use of reference images.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it by using graphite paper, pico or wall projector,<br>or reference images in Krita.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I highly recommend you get a cheap Pen and Tablet,<br>and use the Open Source Krita and rely on the Reference Images feature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just set your reference image to 50% opacity,<br>and know that the eye dropper will pick perfect color from the reference image it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As with everything else these days,<br>begin learning Krita by searching "<span>Krita Tutorial<sup>[1]</sup></span>".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please know not to limit yourself,<br>Krita, as in a Computer Program, opens up new doors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, your passion for drawing,<br>may gravitate towards <span>Jewelry Design<sup>[2]</sup></span> in <span>Blender<sup>[3]</sup></span>, or even <span>Casting Molten Metal<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But please be very careful,<br>as it is very scary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To return to the subject at hand,<br>early on your biggest challenge is all the bullies that will try to belittle you, and call your practice tracing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a derogatory word when used in context of art,<br>and twisted artists use it to eliminate competition or just lift themselves above everyone else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They don't want you to become special,<br>only they want to feel special.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the tragedies of the modern age,<br>is that a lot of good things are poisoned by lies, and lack of real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And liars are everywhere,<br>because of how easy it is to make sh&t up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be strong and be ready,<br>first in art and later in your great pursuits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The pseudo artists on TV want to say,<br>"Oh Vermeer was not a real artist, no, no no, fake, fake, fake".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He was using Camera Obscura,<br>he, was, traaaaaaacing, tracing, tracing tracing.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And if I was into art,<br>I would neeeeeeeeeeeeever ever trace." - blearrgh</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who are most outspoken,<br>probably don't even care to draw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And real artists, neer call themselves artists,<br>they will either decide to stay a permanent art student because of how beautiful learning is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or become real art teachers, because how sad it is that everyone got tricked away from art,<br>and how beautiful it is to see students deliver perfect drawings on their first lecture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to the liars, what they really want,<br>is to stop you from growing <strong>in general</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In their bird brains they secretly believe that if they can prevent the world from learning,<br>they won't really be as stupid as they really are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So your first lesson in a drawing tutorial,<br>is a question:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do yo have the strength to ignore all the people<br>who will say that you are just tracing?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because if you can't ignore them,<br>then you will never learn how to draw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or worse yet, you will only know to draw slightly crooked things,<br>and then condemn yourself to calling your art whimsical.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Liars are everywhere,<br>they want to gain something for nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they can trick you away from art,<br>or prevent you from learning as quickly as you can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or push you away from realism,<br>then they will feel like they control you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will feed their thirst,<br>to feel that they are better than you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The next step is what to do,<br>when people ask you how you did it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the same liars and destroyers,<br>will want you to lie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again here they will be able to say,<br>she is a liar and she's just tracing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, you must be humble, and always say,<br>I am just practicing my shapes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Invite others that are worthy of your kindness,<br>and teach them what you have learned thus far about using direct reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or just say "Even after all those years, I am still just learning,<br>I am just practicing my shapes. I don't think of myself as an artist."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, you can't become an artist because you want to be an artist,<br>that is how liars do it, they just love that label.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are so poor in their minds that they use lying,<br>to make everyone else feel inferior with all their stupid labels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't use the word artist to describe yourself,<br>only these who see your work can apply that word to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can however call yourself a teacher of art,<br>and show others how to do it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never use the word tracing though, because it is a bad word,<br>when used in drawing it is a word used to hurt real artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just say "I am using reference images directly",<br>and explain that you do it out of respect for your models.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The slight crooked approach is wrong, at least at first,<br>slightly-crooked is a style you can do later on, if you feel like it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to begin with Extreme Hyper Realism,<br>and you have to get over your shyness and exhibit your works at local galleries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And remember to always say "I Teach Real Art", or "I am a real Art Teacher",<br>and share, show other how to do it, create tutorials, or even classes at your local coffee shop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars have taken away art,<br>from almost everyone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And crappy teachers brainlessly shame,<br>the use of direct reference in Hyper Realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The liars have won,<br>most people will never know they were born an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In large part,<br>due the sick myth of tracing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hyper Realism and Direct Use Of Reference Images,<br>are proof that you already have the Art School in your hands, that you were born for this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a process that almost feels holy, you will slowly understand light,<br>the perfects shapes and the complexity of shadows on a face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if all you draw and paint is faces,<br>in the upcoming weeks, months, years, and decades, new observations will never stop coming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you take to practice by direct reference now,<br>in just a few perfect portraits, you too will feel the sorrow of a world tricked out of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And thus, portrait by portrait you will grow<br>into a greater and greater teacher, and a Greater Being.</div>
