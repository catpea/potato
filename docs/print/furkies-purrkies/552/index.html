  <div class="paragraph">3D models for printing on 3D printers,<br>sell for about $3 dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With the a neat looking <span>Cat Armor<sup>[1]</sup></span> on Pinshape,<br>which is priced at $12.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think what makes a good 3D model, printed or not,<br>is a beautiful and unique design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that it does not exist in stores,<br>due to its uniqueness - and even if it did, it would be too expensive.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A person that buys a 3D printer for just about $200,<br>can print out an infinite number of knickknacks and curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The stores I see online are not quite there yet,<br>people don't seem to advertise 3D models as proper products with a standalone website.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get a good idea what 3D products look like,<br>vist <span>Thingverse<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>Cults3D<sup>[3]</sup></span>, [Youmagine][], and <span>Pinshape<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Now from a more personal perspective,<br>I recently started learning Blender, a 3D modeling program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">YouTube is full of Blender tutorials,<br>I was pretty fun to learn the basics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender is shipped with a 3D Print plugin that will evaluate geometry of a product,<br>and that truly lowers the on ramp, as one can click Check All, to catch problems at every operation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender allows for operations that 3D printers are not always happy about,<br>the 3D Print plugin is a very pleasant way to learn what one can and cannot do.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>I have created a strange wallet<sup>[5]</sup></span> as part of my self education,<br>And made a series of interesting discoveries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The filament that printers use as "ink" costs $30 dollars for a roll,<br>and lasts for a couple of months - it is best to start with the most popular white filament as white easily hides imperfections.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A print such as my strange wallet,<br>would take about 4 or 5 hours to print.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before a 3D Model (often an stl file) can be printed,<br>it must be sliced by a <span>Slicer<sup>[6]</sup></span>, the .stl file is converted to a .gcode file that printers understand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't give something legs unless you want to print supports,<br>for example when building a simple wallet, one side should be flat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't put a latch on the bottom, as the printers don't like complex shapes on the bottom.<br>though when slicing a model, one has an option to generate supports - awesome for fancy complex sculptures - but not so good for flat wallets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Best product designs are simple, or at least come in multiple parts that are simple,<br>if you wan to have a lion head on your wallet, you should print that as a separate piece.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way the back of the lion is flat, the back of the wallet is flat,<br>and you just need some superglue.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The reason I designed my wallet as a case with hinges,<br>is because my next lesson is in designing a tiny computer case for the little Raspberry PI.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is one big change I will make,<br>and that is to round all the edges, as they come out sharp - it is fantastic how tough that plastic is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made most of my wallet designs two millimeters thin,<br>to print them out very quickly, some of my designs took only an hour to print.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This latest design, has 3 milometer side walls on the main case,<br>it is perfectly tough - all the final designs that require toughness should have 3mm sidewalls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A portable little computer case is a perfect 3mm sidewall candidate,<br>the case will not bend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">3D Prints can have some minor warping,<br>and while temperature control can fix that, it is a good idea to plan for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The earlier design had a top without any side walls,<br>plus I was testing experimental hinges which multiplied misalignment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This new top design, has overhanging edges,<br>and if there is any warping to the plastic, the top will still align perfectly, and the minor warping will actually contribute to keep the wallet closed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Modeling for a 3D printer,<br>is proper Industrial Design, whether an experienced designer of hobbyist, it is the same kind of fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My earlier design though sturdy enough,<br>had a card sized hole when improperly closed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't have a side wall up-front to easily slide cards out, when open,<br>but that also meant it had a credit card sized hole for the credit card to fall out if improperly closed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My latest design has only has a hole for thumb and index finger on each side,<br>I restored the front wall that would allow cards to fall out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It only took a few moments, but it was a wonderful feeling,<br>expanding my own creation, to account for new features and concerns.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Making my little wallet-case taught me absolutely everything I need to know,<br>to make my little computer case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, I think I will be one of very few people,<br>who will build a Raspberry Pi case with with hinges where one can open it for easy access to the GPIO connectors, or even the SDcard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My hinged Raspberry PI case with proper manifold geometry,<br>will be my first - dollar or two - product that I will sell in an online digital goods store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I plan on having multiple case variations,<br>something that would be cumbersome for a 3D printed product as one would be printing parts that the customer would not have use for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a digital product, I can include cases that support batteries or various sizes,<br>or allow for securely mounting the case on top of a large power-bank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can even cover multiple recent variations of the Raspberry Pi models,<br>while featuring universal addons that snap onto all the different cases.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One can easily imagine how someone would prefer to buy a kit and a printer,<br>rather than continue buying new cases as they expand their inexpensive Pi collection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the cases I hope to design is a Raspberry Pi Camera Case,<br>which is less of a case and more of a camera, really.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, I would like to add that selling digital models,<br>does not mean that customers must own a 3D printer, as they can choose to have their digital models printed during checkout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will explore that configuration,<br>when I begin designing small sculptures and jewelry pieces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world sure has changed a little bit, video tutorials hold knowledge that previously required tutoring,<br>and one can easily buy a printer that can slowly extrude the entire contents of a dollar store - wow.</div>
