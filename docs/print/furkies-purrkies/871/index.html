    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't just learn one thing,<br>that's impossible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only is everything connected,<br>you will connect it in a unique way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People say that Newton,<br>had this powerful learning method.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But,<br>he didn't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It looked difficult and powerful to strangers,<br>but in his mind...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He wasn't even merely following his curiosities,<br>he was just having fun.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Real education,<br>is about having fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact,<br>jack of all trades and a master of none.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is an uneducated and jealous person's description,<br>of someone who is spiraling upwards in self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is true for all that,<br>that nobody sticks with a subject for long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because some weeks into it,<br>they will begin missing some other talent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example a person programming may miss art,<br>and a painter may miss composing music after a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There comes a point is ready to switch,<br>and they do, and they continue having fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">T o someone shallow that will seem like failure,<br>but it is actually like a growth spur.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When a self educated person switches subject,<br>they don't just resume where they left off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They approach the subject they were longing for,<br>on a whole new level.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can see how different this is,<br>from standardized schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized education,<br>is an uneducated person's idea of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They send you through steps,<br>and you come out smarter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is you were smarter all along,<br>but they just wasted years of your life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In most cases,<br>they tricked people out of real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students that graduate with more knowledge,<br>know more, not because they received an education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But because they allowed the teachers,<br>to force them into learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For praise, good grades,<br>promise of some career.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it was the worst kind of learning,<br>out of sequence, all cut up, and void of joy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized education is like telling an artist,<br>when to paint, what to paint, and when to finish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And under the threat of prison, and ridicule,<br>of being held back one year, and permanently marked as delayed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers pretending to teach to get paychecks, and Students pretending to learn by memorizing to get out of there,<br>and because education is what separates us from cavemen, or war and slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake or ineffective education is as dangerous as ignoring climate change,<br>or watching population grow by 7 billion in the span of a single lifetime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But let's set dark imaginings aside,<br>you are as brilliant and as capable as any genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all you are a Citizen Of The World,<br>and you belong to no nation, or cult.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Go to the library, find your first audio book... if you haven't already,<br>maybe Bill Bryson, or Randall Munroe, Carl Sagan or Neil deGrasse Tyson.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin your upward cycle of self education,<br>and go all the way up - until you become a great being.</div>
