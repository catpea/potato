  <div class="paragraph">It has been three weeks since I drew the Hoistu Cat,<br>and last week I added the realism component that makes lowbrow so fascinating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the biggest lesson that I have learned is to keep things simple,<br>the absurd can quickly get out of control.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is waiting to trip you up,<br>when you make something too complex.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can paint a person and their dog,<br>but it is not a good idea to switch them in any way, for any reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pop Surrealism demand simplicity,<br>embrace it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Even with this enormous warning,<br>Pop surrealism absolutely is the most beautiful form of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not realism, not the cheerful colors of impressionism,<br>nor the step towards the abstract of post-impressionism...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pop Surrealism is it,<br>it is one of Humanity's most precious inventions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We may look back at Mona Lisa and wonder in awe,<br>but when we glance at lowbrow, we will burst out in laughter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What an enormous power to have,<br>and it is not just about people of today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People thousands of years from now,<br>will be giggling at our art.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Lowbrow Art, Pop Surrealism,<br>has the power to make someone a thousand years from now, lose it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The work in the Title Image is yet another <span>response to Reddit Gets Drawn<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and it does come along with a <span>Time-lapse video<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While painting it, I laughed in ways that I can't describe,<br>it certainly is the most foolish thing I've ever created.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I wish that every person would take to art,<br>just to experience that kind of laughter.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Long before we take to the starts,<br>we will have built countless worlds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each painting,<br>is a birth of a really interesting Universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anything silly can give birth to a new idea,<br>be it a silly puppy, or a funny word, art will take it so far out that you will find yourself smiling and laughing.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Art is not just for the artist,<br>just like doing a little dance, or humming a neat song, or cheerfully prancing around - art is part of the experience of life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just like we have to practice a dance move,<br>and take a while to learn how to whistle, we have to learn how to trace, and as a result how to draw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not so much about showing the world who we are,<br>but about showing the world that we <strong>are</strong>.</div>
