      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Art Of Growing Up</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Uninterrupted Growing Up is a big deal for our minds as we grow,<br>but it is also very difficult to everyone around us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For one the world is poor,<br>everyone is tired and stressed out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when one person is moved by Museums,<br>another may get really bored by going there every week.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being a parent is tough,<br>Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva comes to mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I love how she used to say that children should appreciate: the gift of words on paper,<br>she knew, she learned from books on her own, so she knew about inheriting knowledge from great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Dimitri<sup>[1]</sup></span> got in to the school,<br>the same year she passed away from tuberculosis.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me just add that Dimitri had bad grades in the Classics, Latin and German,<br>but he did well in mathematics, physics and the sciences.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Abstract thinking,<br>figures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But no one, no matter how little,<br>can ask for what Maria did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even when we are little,<br>we have to stand up for growing up, largely on our own, we have to make big plans.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is when we are little that we can really easily narrow down our interests,<br>I was curious about the stars, I remember writing a short thing about the Kosmos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I had a book that, ^might have been dated a bit^ because it said that Mars had seasonal changes of color,<br>that the color shifted towards brown during Autumn, because of falling leaves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't buy it, but before I was going to return to that subject,<br>I needed to read about all the other things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I found it very interesting that Grafting Apple trees was common practice,<br>I immediately developed an interest in Combinatorial Geneomics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Venter<sup>[2]</sup></span> packing codes into chromosome sequences,<br>and that darn article entitled <span>DNA seen through the eyes of a coder<sup>[3]</sup></span> could not be more fascinating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I returned to Mars,<br>I got snagged on <span>Mokele-mbembe<sup>[4]</sup></span> and of course X-Files.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But even though this is a fairy tale, that was born of per-historic dinosaur bones, much like myths of dragons,<br><span>there are still great adventures to be had in that area of the world<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bringing together solar, communication, single board computers,<br>cameras, virtual classrooms, solar mp3 players...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Can make for a really interesting classroom,<br>especially when smart <span>Raspberry PI Zero<sup>[6]</sup></span> based<br><span>Video Software<sup>[7]</sup></span> that can operate a <span>Night Vision Camera<sup>[8]</sup></span> is very inexpensive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And can make beautiful videos that can help us watch Africa,<br>in a new light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is difficult to talk about something as deeply personal as the Continuity of Growing Up,<br>for one it seems like it is not something that is granted to all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But like Maria teachers us,<br>it is something we must each fight for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to make our way towards books that inspire us,<br>even if all we can do is to spend a life time to build the first book lending network in our part of Congo, or Amazon, or Outback, or Siberia.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When knowledge is taken away from us,<br>we have to take it back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I also had an interest in Archaeology,<br>my parents took me to see Castles and Museums.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In context of archaeology, I was ravenous, and rabid,<br>I had no reservations when it came to fake education, so as long as I was learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memorizing dates, overwork, unpaid-internships<br>and digs in dangerous places on the brink of military coups, was my middle name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I was allowed to roam free, they would have pulled me into Oxford,<br>to give me an education so that I could learn to follow at least some of the rules.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oxford Archaeology by the way, is one of the largest and oldest archaeology practices in Europe,<br>it is a stone throw away from where I used to live, and had I been allowed to grow up, I would have become a brilliant thorn in their side.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I grew up by <span>Ślęża<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>so I would have dug for the Tribes that worshiped <span>Mother Bear<sup>[10]</sup></span>, that <span>Worshiped The Sun<sup>[11]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would have gathered all my Artio statues on Midsummer Night for all to see,<br>as an old man I would have inspired hundreds to Archaeology, to books, to the gift of words on paper, as Maria would say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today is June 25th,<br>what better day to celebrate Midsummer Day, than a Friday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is my celebration,<br>to mention Artio, and the <span>Queen of the Fae<sup>[12]</sup></span> and show the world that Myths are amazing teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After all, what can teach the Kingly Virtues, better,<br>than the Arthurian legend.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Similarly, The discovery of a passage in a science book,<br>that mentions there being trees on Mars, is a call to great adventure like few other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not just an interplanetary adventure,<br>it is an interstellar adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One, that has a real beginning with <span>Percival Lowell<sup>[13]</sup></span>,<br>and his observatory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And beautiful Speculative and Impecable Poetry and Hard Science of cosmos,<br>and our place in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Inspired by <span>Frank Drake<sup>[14]</sup></span>, driven by the wonderful <span>Jill Tarter<sup>[15]</sup></span><br>and lovable and funny <span>Seth Shostak<sup>[16]</sup></span> the SETI Institute.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jill Tarter inspired the character of Ellie played by Jodie Foster in Carl Sagan's Cosmos,<br><span>Ms. Tarter reminds us that if we are alone then it is an awful waste of space<sup>[17]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are neither Trees nor canals on Mars,<br>but these ideas were only meant to be questions, that would be matched by answers provided by proper science.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What was a stepping stone for Percival Lowell,<br>became a launch pad for people like Carl Sagan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Sagan was very fond on Martian Adventures<sup>[18]</sup></span>,<br>he says he would spread his arms at night and wish to be transported to Mars like <span>John Carter<sup>[19]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy and odyssey, and even X-Files and Mokele-mbembe continue inspiring countless generations,<br>not just to more fiction but also to science.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ANd to daring Greatly, in new fields like Combinatorial Genomics,<br><span>where we are just getting started with ideas like synthetic life and the creation of new species<sup>[20]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Continuity, can take us to the infinite future<sup>[21]</sup></span>,<br><span>or can help us understand our ancient past<sup>[22]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It matters not if it starts with dreams of canals or fighting aliens on Mars,<br>or capturing a photo of Mokele-mbembe, all dreams are equally good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it does matter that the continuity of our dreams of adventure is unbroken,<br>so that each step lies on top of the previous step, and that we grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let anybody push you away from your dreams,<br>not your brothers or sister, not mom not dad, not preachers, nor teachers; your dreams, are yours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If there is a force that is pushing you already, and seems impenetrable,<br>then you are in luck, because the Universes has chosen for you, to become a Great Warrior and Leader, and a force of change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fantastic stories are not just for entertainment,<br>if you are young then let John Carter teach you strategy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The continuity of your growing up can only be broken if you don't realize how precious it is,<br>the path of great adventures, intergalactic fantasies, and inspirational curiosities that lies before you, is your to travel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is your responsibility to build your mind step by uninterrupted step,<br>to make each day better than the previous, and to make yourself strong enough to stand up to the meanest and biggest creatures of the best of the fantasy books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When people come to tell you that you can't dream of Mars, or Stars, or Past or Future, Science, Technology, and or Philosophy,<br>just tell them, that what they say is pretty good...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is not good enough for you, because your aim is Greatness,<br>growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to become a Great Being you have much to learn,<br>and that you will learn it your own way, at your own pace, and in a sequence that fits you best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not good enough,<br>because the world needs you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world must advance,<br>it cannot stand still.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The World,<br>Must Grow.</div>
