  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against you,<br>and in a way that is true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when you don't know what to do,<br>let Mona Lisa Come to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get a <span>Pen Tablet<sup>[1]</sup></span> and learn <span>GIMP<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>Krita<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>Inkscape<sup>[4]</sup></span>, <span>Blender<sup>[5]</sup></span>, and to use an <span>Ender<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>speed thy slowly, and don't let the world force you to become a pretender.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If it seems like the adults don't care,<br>than that means the world need repair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If things seem to be made of out plastic,<br>then the changes you need to made will be drastic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If it quacks like a duck,<br>or if sometimes you hear a cluck.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is a sign that the world got tangled and confused,<br>and the older you, will not be amused.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If High School seems fake,<br>then you need to study for real, for your own sake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know the grades are fake they always are,<br>and it goes all the way up to the General's star.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Please learn on your won, for real,<br>a real education is still a huge deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Start with Linux and Graphic Design,<br>and know that the future is something that you define.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what you maybe told,<br><span>Graphic Design is one of the most beautiful pursuits in the world<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is not about working eight hours per day in High School,<br>you are meant to become a Great Being, not a tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not about a little paycheck every week,<br>that future <strong>always</strong> looks bleak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is about you rising up, and up, to no end,<br>not about following the main trend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Politics and school are confused,<br>because all the talking heads are bruised.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The adults are pretending,<br>they are <strong>waiting</strong> for some kind of a meaningful ending.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But meaning is something that we each have to build,<br>it cannot be merely willed.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your Wisdom, Art Skills and resulting <span>Business Startups<sup>[8]</sup></span> are a strong beginning,<br>they serve as a fine underpinning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But then you have to continue growing,<br>and without ever slowing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to grow all the way up and outgrow all the adults,<br>as that is the only way to get at the true results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the things that you can sense to be broken,<br>are a kind of a personal token.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As those are the things you must aim to repair,<br>to help those, who fall into the same despair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stop making compromises, and stop agreeing,<br>as you have been challenged to grow into a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though your future is an endless ocean,<br>all new beginnings start with a simple notion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let Mona Lisa guide you, as you copy and learn to paint just as well,<br>let it be the first step, to help you out of your shell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But remember, do not follow, build your <strong>own</strong> way to the top,<br>and when you get there, keep going and don't stop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me say one more thing to you,<br>and I swear that this is true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not about somebody else helping the world,<br>most people are just doing what they are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It <strong>really matters</strong> what <strong>you</strong> do,<br>because the world can't get better, without you.</div>
