  <div class="paragraph">Stretching reference images over the entire canvas,<br>making them transparent and using them as shape and color reference is awesome.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a powerful idea,<br>that can have you selling your paintings in no time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a perfect start,<br>of your perfect art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a looooong time to paint,<br>and dream, and think about things, there is no time in art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">When you are ready,<br>the next steps are near.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I like my portfolio,<br>the same way I like my websites plain and simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not as simple as it sounds,<br>but it is simplest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made all my works square,<br>and I focused on just parading the top nine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which when all glued together,<br>make another square.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This quilt of color,<br>which I named pieces of nine...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Makes your website beautiful,<br>and your portfolio, stand out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A consistent portfolio,<br>tells your customers what they are getting for the price you ask.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Because of the way catpea works,<br>I use the montage command from ImageMagick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And simply say,<br>montage image/lg-poetry-{0695,0707,0704,0713,0714,0716,0720,0724,0727}-illustration.jpg -tile 3x3 -geometry 500x500 portfolio.jpg</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you keep things consistent, you can automate a lot of stuff,<br>and here I even created a little invention portfolio dot jpeg, that asks, "what are your nine best works?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is program hiding in here,<br>a swift and lightweight stream based static site generator, learning programming goes really well with learning art.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Do not get discouraged or tricked by low portrait prices,<br>people set them low to entice a customer to upgrades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An honest artist will sell a portrait for a $100,<br>and $50 can get a business going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of people will avoid $10 or $25 dollar portraits,<br>because they get burned, or know it is a trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I find my most detailed works require nine to twelve hours,<br>so a full day's work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the true value of a beautiful portrait,<br>starts at $500, and it also comes with some extras.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Time-lapse for one, the reference technique helps you create such perfect creations,<br>that not everyone will believe you actually painted them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Time-lapse videos are both,<br>fascinating keepsakes, and proof of your perfect art.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Every powerful artist,<br>must also be a teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as you work on your Portfolio and sales,<br>you also need to prepare 12 lectures worth of material.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ideas, customization, shortcuts, observations,<br>and exercises, all wrapped up in a thousand dollar tutorial set for starting artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is really important to work on your lectures,<br>and you maybe invited for a semester or two to your local community college.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Photo realism, your technique, and body of knowledge,<br>is a precious treasure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose to keep your portfolio square as I do,<br>the works that no longer belong to it, must be featured in your Coffee Table book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very important to keep a journal open as you paint,<br>as you may want to attach a quote, or a paragraph or even a story to each of your works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cover image,<br>is of course the pieces of nine, or your own equivalent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never aim to write a book,<br>and of my gosh, don't try to organize it into chapters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A book, like happiness, must ensue, to paraphrase Dr. Frankl,<br>books are born from articles you write, from notes you take.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The truth about your Coffee Table or Art Book,<br>is that it creates it self, it is not a to do item, it is a thing you eventually discover that you already have.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Once portraits are part of you,<br>you will search for more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often this becomes a call to full figure poses,<br>where you move beyond the face, and take to fashion and especially pose and hands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, you will be called even higher,<br>and that maybe the call of Fantasy Art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An increase in complexity,<br>is a very healthy thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a symptom,<br>of you having internalized art.</div>
