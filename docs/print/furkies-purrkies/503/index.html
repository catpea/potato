    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have this silly flaw of believing most things,<br>and this really small curse of underestimating ourselves - I don't know why - but here is how to get rid of both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, All Human Beings are Infinite, and Mighty,<br>and a lot smarter than they will ever know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Infinity, means that only liars fall to pieces,<br>healthy humans that follow their curiosity have no reason to fall apart, they love life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as we are authentic, we are mighty,<br>who could possibly lose their strength in the middle of their beautiful journey.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the reason why many people are easily tricked into thinking they are not smart,<br>is because they've been taught falsehoods, or things were kept from them; or warped for them;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, even when a person isn't mislead, they may imagine smarts, intelligence, intellect, brains,<br>as an object that one must carry around and have ready at all times, they forget there is this thing called learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To make things simple, I would redefine intelligence,<br>as ability to learn things that we want to know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We learn about things that we are passionate about so quickly,<br>that it almost doesn't matter what we know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The silly flaw is that we accept almost everything, without question,<br>it is probably how liars get around, it certainly is the road that cults travel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first thing that we should learn in Science Class is:<br>"Question Everything".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just two words, a wisdom reduced to perfection,<br>by scientific minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I know that there are real profe4ssors out there that make questioning into homework,<br>and ask the students to make a short list of all the things they questioned - and just entertain themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is always that student, that picks one of the big religions, and goes,<br>"If an international business can be build on foundation of fantasy, war, and torture... Why should we take smaller organizations like this school for granted."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...And the professor, walks up to her, bows,<br>and hands her... a freaking... brand new iPad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you get the point, our flaw is fixed by two words,<br><strong>Question Everything</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Question grades, poverty, and wars,<br>question politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while you're at it, ask yourself,<br>if there is anything other than war, weapons, and disease that has ever enriched a nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is an important question for this century,<br>this century will be the beginning of us rebuilding how a Human Life should be lived.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even-companies that profit from violating peoples privacy, even! if the users have signed it away,<br>will get it, this kind of feeding on unsuspecting users that just want to share some photos, will unravel even the biggest companies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stuff like weapons manufacturing, even if they proclaim to have merely followed orders,<br>will all come undone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are just learning more,<br>people are growing up more informed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the political pretenders and lairs,<br>the multi-faced leaders are exposed, they count on noise and ignorance - but that only exists in their own heads.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then there is the small curse,<br>which is that we are somehow cursed to underestimate ourselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one ever feels as smart as they really are,<br>as beautiful as they truly are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the solution is somewhat more complex,<br>though still has a two word "thing".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the two words that you have to remember are:<br><strong>Beautiful Opposite</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we have to find the beautiful opposite,<br>of what we suspect is this terrible thing that we have, and can't ever fix, and everybody else can, but we can't, ever, whatever... is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is tough, because for example, if someone swears they are ugly,<br>not only do they have to identify that this them underestimating themselves, but they have to do the Beautiful Opposite.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is all different for all,<br>if a heavy person feels ugly, then they have to realize they have lived for decades while wearing a Weight Vest, something that bodybuilders can only dream of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Meaning, that when they finally find their beauty and slow down with exercise,<br>they will also be very muscular.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And more importantly, not do they become beautiful bodybuilders,<br>but also add 50 years to their life, if not more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they will have a natural instinct to walk the <span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>something that people who aren't overweight have to really work on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some may become adventurers that prefer smaller trails, with more curiosities on them,<br>others may take to ripping all their kitchen appliances out with great fanfare and triumph, and start dancing to hip-hop, maybe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Question Everything, and Beautiful Opposite,<br>are the cure for our troubles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In my experience <strong>Question Everything</strong> sends us drifting towards Beautifully Narrated Books,<br>and <strong>Beautiful Opposite</strong>, actually sends us on adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So in this way, this Flaw of Indoctrination, and Curse of Underestimation,<br>is a kind of a launchpad, for greater things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as we remember those four words,<br>we are neither flawed, nor cursed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what is more, we are well on our way towards great adventures,<br>and the constant transcendence of our limits onward to becoming Great Beings.</div>
