    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should try to extend the ancient or medieval art styles,<br>even if just to understand them better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a kind of look into history, and while you are designing,<br>a <span>Dacian Bracelet<sup>[1]</sup></span> to pick a random example, learn a little bit about <span>Dacians<sup>[2]</sup></span> that used to occupy what is Romania, today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art allows you to time travel a little bit,<br>and poetically speaking, it is more than just imagination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By recreating an object from an ancient culture,<br>you will be able to gently touch back in time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not studying history here,<br>you first choose a beautiful object from some culture, and then visit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want to emphasize,<br>that <span>your search for those cultures should begin by locating artifacts that speak to your soul<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let me assure you, that once you are connected,<br>they will speak back to you with their history and legends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is magic,<br>behind every ancient piece of jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, the spiral motif in Dacian culture,<br>is not just a twist of a wire; that is the symbol of the sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And do not limit yourself to Jewelry only, for one Ancient Romans had fancy cutlery,<br>their soldiers had foldable versions, and folding knives with gadgets even.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Ancient Greeks had breathtaking earrings,<br>just look at <span>Earring with Nike driving a two-horse chariot<sup>[4]</sup></span> at the Museum Of Fine Art In Boston.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there are things that we forgot about like the <span>Diadem<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>a type of crown, that should absolutely make a return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or Armlets, jewelry worn around upper arm,<br>a set of matching Rings, Bracelets, Armlets and a Diadem is not hard to design in Blender.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Decorative axe heads, daggers and even warpicks,<br>may not even need to be printed in metal as they make great plastic letter openers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bringing back ancient coins by rebuilding them in Blender,<br>can make for decorative additions that you can attach to bracelets or necklaces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course every culture has figurines,<br>stone age goddesses that would look beautiful on a pendant.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ancient Roman silver mice,<br>that to this day beg to be part of every home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And my goodnes, we need to bring back the Rhyton,<br>I canâ€™t even imagine the reason why we stopped using drinking from horns.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you find comfort in some ancinet culture, go visit the places where they used to live,<br>visit the museums that hold the physical pieces that inspired you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What a great way to explore history and the world,<br>and how magical and unforgettable the adventures that follow.</div>
