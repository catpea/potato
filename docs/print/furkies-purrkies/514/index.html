    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Adventures, quests, vacations, camping, and roads trips,<br>very often help our minds rest and recover from overwork.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is some negativity associated with travel,<br>people who move around are looked down on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, I think some people take to longer travels,<br>when they feel like they are away from themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think they need support,<br>not negativity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need to be encouraged,<br>to find themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once they feel comfy again,<br>they'll ease up with their travels.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Overwork, and getting caught up in complexities of life,<br>also has the effect of making the world seem much simpler than it really is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People are way to overworked,<br>an they overlook, and sometimes forget all the things that are beautiful to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The things that are beautiful to us,<br>are our map to growing all the way up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a great tragedy,<br>that we can only live once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is no need for a better reason,<br>to set of on a series, of comfy adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no arguing that we are each an artist,<br>and our hidden talents exist in the reals of Composing Music, Painting Grand Portraits, Clay Sculpture, and more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Out minds need us to find ways to make those connections,<br>each time we travel from one star to the next, we grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finding ourselves, scanning for the stars and building new constellations,<br>is as tough as finding an interesting book with a good narrator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a hobby, or a travel destination,<br>don't expect the first one to become the bees knees.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, there is a period of maybe three or five days,<br>for the hold that overwork has on us to weaken and let go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Living in a state of overwork,<br>and always pushing vacation away, is very sad, and unhealthy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once we figure all this out,<br>we have to help others to their little adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't let anything interrupt our growing up,<br>we don't have to become great orators with great speeches on our resume.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we can't let poverty, or career, or office politics,<br>stand in our way of growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least, we should try to imagine our elder selves,<br>and see what their regrets may be, if any.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In closing and on a personal note,<br>many years ago when I went on my adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I discovered I loved good books,<br>up until then I only read a bunch of cheap paperbacks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when I got a hold of Bill Bryson's <span>A Short History of Nearly Everything<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>not only did I discover I liked big books, but also that I liked day dreaming about Science.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Before then, I always though I was more of a Computer and Art person,</div>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>and now I wonder if maybe I could become a writer of short and funny stories,</li>
</ul>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is another thing that we gain when we discover our constellations,<br>we become foolish and cheerful, and full of funny tings to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, <span>grab a tent even if just to camp in your back yard<sup>[2]</sup></span>, or a new audio book; or oils, canvas and an easel; or a brick of air dry clay, and start searching for your next star.<br>and remember we are <em>all</em> meant to become Great Beings, and every great journey starts with a tiny step.</div>
