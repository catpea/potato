  <div class="paragraph">Money, and it is difficult for you to believe that,<br>because <span>all the teachers want to sell you out, no exceptions<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can’t afford to care,<br><span>if they start caring about you, they will lose their jobs<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they start caring about how you feel,<br>then they will have to <span>face all the students<sup>[3]</sup></span> that they <strong>already</strong> sold out for a paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every grade, less than an A F****G plus, was a lie,<br>it NEVER had anything to do with your intelligence, it was always about your obedience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because if you obey, if you follow the directions,<br>they can get paid, they can live a life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not obedient,<br>then you are interfering with their ability to put food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will throw you under the bus,<br>and you will repeat the last year of High School.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They just want to get paid,<br>they can’t go off script.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers have instructions for lectures, you got your textbooks,<br>there are matching tests, matching finals, and matching state tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are people who will swear,<br>there are people who will swear they are improving quality of lectures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They also want to get paid,<br>they try very hard to forget the <span>tests are standardized, and thus cant work<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But if you put up with it all,<br>a almost all teachers will try to slide you along, then everything will look fine on paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You’ll go to college, get in debt,<br>and that debt will motivate you, as if your credit score was your new GPA.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of people in their 60s are still paying off their schools,<br>they have no choice, student loans are unforgivable by bankruptcy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will be forcefully,<br>taken out of you paycheck.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, relax, it is all horse shit,<br>you are smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers are just temporarily hurting you,<br>so that you start memorizing, so that they can get paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact you are so smart,<br>and you ability to <span>navigate that which you do comprehend<sup>[5]</sup></span> is so powerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That if I told you just how powerful your mind is,<br>you would call this poem horseshit, and start memorizing to improve your grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we don’t want that,<br>so I won’t tell you how smart you really are.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I will talk about famous neck beard for a moment,<br>he’s currently resting at Westminster Abby.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You know how he cracked the laws of universe,<br>he didn’t independently invent calculus by merely studying math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though he knew enough math,<br>to truly calculate a circle from an ellipse, poor bastard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He did it by building models,<br>he hid them from everyone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He hid them harder,<br>than his dumb-ass research for turning led to gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was trying to present him self,<br>as super smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He wasn’t a genius,<br>he was just doing what school is robbing you off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I am so sorry about that,<br>I never stopped wishing I could fix it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">He was just slowly, very slowly, kissing up to his curiosities,<br>he was moving so slowly that the lovely Neil DeGrasse Tyson...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by contrast,<br>moving at the speed of light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Neil's explanation for learning math<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>is just regurgitate until it makes sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I give that advice for learning complicated computer programs,<br>that have video tutorials but no documentation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Steven Hawking explained it better than Mr. Tyson<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>by infinitely emphasizing the important of the study of the <span>HISTORY of mathematics<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can’t learn math for real,<br>without gently following its history dot for dot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools,<br>aren’t capable of teaching Math, you can only memorize your PIr2,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is wrong, Because it is TAU,<br>and you need to stick with Unit Circle, so there is no r, it is just 1.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The whole formula for circle,<br>is just tau, just 3.14.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Modern Trigonometry instruction is horseshit too<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>it is horrifying what they are doing to you, I am so sorry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to let go of stressing out about grades, graduations, and horseshit,<br>and you have to start learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don’t be the kid that gets the good grades,<br>or that freaks out about being held back a year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are going to be held back an extra year in High School,<br>that does not mean the bullies have one, it means you get to be young for an extra year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you are only going to get an extra year,<br>before they start calling you gifted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to books,<br>don’t read them, that really sucks, listen to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to all of them,<br>you have to, because you are not going to get a real education in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you have bullies at home or school, know that what they really want,<br>is to turn you into a bull too, use the police to fight back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be more careful in life,<br>you shouldn't have ever let anyone trick you into thinking that you are not smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there are others who have been tricked in similar ways,<br>or if you notice someone stressing about their A’s way too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Put a book club together,<br>call it the A-Team, trade your books together, and resist life trying to tell you apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you know,<br>change the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Come your golden are share your Life’s Lessons in such a way,<br>that others may begin, where you leave off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make no mistake, the meaning of life, is to become a great being,<br>by means of real and authentic education, which at the moment means, self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time you graduate High School, you need to master Programming node.js <span>for your startups<sup>[10]</sup></span>, Photo Realism in Krita,<br>3d Modeling and Geometry Nodes in Blender, Industrial Design and 3D Printing, and at the very least, Berlin School Techo in LMMS.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't let the world trick you out of real education,<br>every new thing yo learn must perfect must perfectly fit your existing knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the wonderful chaos of life, you won't retain things that you do not practice,<br>and you can't practice things that aren't integrated into what you care about.</div>
