      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Transforming Fake Education Into Real Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is broken, ineffective, or fake,<br>and provides no real results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And certainly,<br>no results that are reliably reproducible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I propose,<br>introducing several new classes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These classes will create a starting point,<br>from which the new schools can emerge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These classes already have a new format,<br>and they do not feature grades, just real and life changing information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most difficult subject, is that of healthy relationships,<br>as there has been a ongoing problem that colleges and universities try to hide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The primary focus right now, is to undue the seemingly self propagating myths,<br>about what it means to become a man.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because what boys currently think it is,<br>is not that far off from participating in deliberate emotional exploitation and general predation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Taking advantage of the emotionally hurt,<br>or those who don't yet have the necessary culture or knowledge to make the correct choices is more likely to prevent a boy from ever becoming a man.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here I would like to note that, <span>a college town should not present drugs and alcohol as one of the things to do<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>because only a monster would do that to a young person, especially a young person under the stress of fake education and very real debt and poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I propose the name of this class is <strong>Love</strong>,<br>and the starting point for the most tragic subject, can be found in one of Jon Krakauer's books Missoula.<br>(I will not read this book, but I trust Mr. Krakauer based on his other works)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a very important subject, and as deeply sad and tragic it is,<br>It must stand as the first and foremost topic that comes up when speaking about making improvement to world's education systems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children need to understand that what makes a Human Being mature is not even age,<br>it does not matter if someone is 50, if they didn't grow in Knowledge and Wisdom then they are sill a child in their mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The second new Class I propose is called <strong>Poverty And Money</strong>,<br>it's primary purpose it to state in no uncertain terms that:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity has blindly created an artificial problem,<br>that causes great harm to our family, to our minds, to our bodies, and to our education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without anybody interning to do so,<br>we have begun advancing humanity by using money and inducing poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This unintended consequence,<br>is a major cause behind crime, I leave it to the reader to conduct the research or locate the necessary citations - if any.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have been taught, that if money was free,<br>there would be inflation and the nations would collapse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect this is correct,<br>but the collapse of nations is a much smaller problem than world poverty, that harms everyone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Children need to understand that this is an artificial problem,<br>and they need to come up with a solution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The starting point I propose here,<br>is a world bank that does not track debt of the people that use it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To prevent whatever collapse putting food on the table and repairing the world will cause,<br>the card may come with a dignified daily spending limit, the discussion of what that limit should be should start at $100 per day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be businesses that will attempt to exploit this,<br>but if they tamper with prices, they will be temporary banned from processing those payments.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One important point to notice here is that,<br>having a $100 per day, will put money into local businesses.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will not shut them down,<br>nor will the the upper daily limit, cause any run away inflation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The class should also note that it was previously impossible to create a bank like this,<br>for three reasons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Credit cards and computer networks are a new invention, until the invention of cards there was no way to set a spending limit,<br>and until computers started running this show, it was impossible to effectively detect and ban businesses tampering with prices and related fraud.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The third class on my list is called Fake Education,<br>it is a class that discusses the differences between fake or ineffective education and a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One strong point that must be touched upon here,<br>is whether or not the teachers have what they need to teach for real...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if so,<br><span>why is it that they have been blindly participating in a fundamentally broken system<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being able to identify fake education is critical,<br>to getting a real one, and this is the class that helps the student ask the right question and spot the fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the questions that maybe asked,<br>is the importance of staying current with Narrated Version of the Great Books written by contemporary honorable intellectuals, that clearly display a love and concern for humanity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a related question,<br>of relative importance of overpriced textbooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children taking these classes,<br>are soon going to become the new intellectuals that create such inspirational and beloved works - why are they denied access to these books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And why are they forced to low quality disconnected fact textbooks,<br>that are mostly used in rote memorization, if even that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Children must be taught to identify when they are being taken advantage of by means of grades,<br>grades that belong to a system of threats, threat of punishment, threat of being seen as stupid, threat of being held back, threat of being laughed at, threat of being alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In 2017, 6,241 US Students ended their life,<br>please understand, that school is meant to be the happiest place in our early memories - what we have today is a disgrace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a system of abuse, or shame, and a system of destruction of delicate minds,<br>minds that are each capable of Greatness, that do operate on genius level, but also minds that will cease to grow if they connect their intelligence with the meaningless GPA.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many students see their grade, especially the low GPA,<br>as a measure of their intelligence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bad grades only come from not memorizing disconnected facts,<br>there is nothing lo learn for real in today's schools as everything is divided up into meaninglessness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A child learns by making small steps in the general direction of whatever their next noble pursuit is,<br>only a sick and truly uneducated person could assume that a child learns by hopping from subject to subject five or ten times a day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Classes must not be disconnect, they must be self directed, self paced,<br>and a child's education must be a road marked by meaningful milestones and achievements that they are proud of, not just during education but for decades after their graduation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Examples of such achievements are learning the language of mathematics by having learned programming first and taking to create breathtaking generative art shown in galleries across the world,<br>or learning 3D modeling for the purpose of creating and more importantly selling real and unique, and beautiful products.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until we have a better way to identify ineffective education,<br>I propose that moneymaking is used as a measure of results and effectiveness of their education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you marking the medical school argument here,<br>understand that 250,000 possibly 440,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical errors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The issue of charging for college education must be touched upon here as well,<br>college is not different from high school, it is just as bad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stealing the saving of the families that think their child is getting a real education,<br>and putting the student in debt, for years to come - is nothing short evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this notion ob balanced education, must become a symbol of what it really stands for: FRAUD,<br>because an education that is anything other than integrated is simply a fake education.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a related, somewhat more external subject here,<br>and that is the subject of fake and ineffective politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a waste of time to write about it at any length,<br>but I think the starting point here should be the study of crimes committed by politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here I would point to the <span>List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>and note that the "See also" section should be a starting point for more on the subject.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Money, Corruption, and Insider Trading, as well as all the other mistakes in all politics,<br>is a subject that must be discussed middle school on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which reads me to a related subject, Indoctrination,<br>and here I have to beg a pardon, and ask all the religions people to skip this section.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is an extremely important lesson that every child must fully comprehend,<br>and that is the scale on which fantasy institutions thrive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If there is a large institution, that falls within the range of size of a global church,<br>then the church should be all the proof necessary to question it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If a fantasy reality is to be propagated,<br>then everything else can be rationally and fundamentally questioned, by the generation hat IS ABOUT TO INHERIT IT.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must stop propagating mistakes,<br>wold poverty, war, suffering, struggling, science denial, ignorance of climate, stockpiling nuclear weapons, and keeping <span>3,750 active nuclear warheads ready to destroy all major cities<sup>[4]</sup></span>, MUST STOP WITH US.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a problem for children to inherit,<br>if anything this is a reason, why they shouldn't hear a word we have to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, Richard Dawkins states that religious people,<br>that are bound to a particular religion, are atheists towards all the other religions, and asks that they take that extra step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Children are susceptible to indoctrination, this must not be exploited as children should become better than the previous generation, or there will never be an end to suffering,<br>Dawkins correctly identifies pushing a child into a particular religion, as a form of abuse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children are the future of the world,<br>they don't need the crunches of the previous generations, they just need a global end to Poverty, and Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you who use religion to deal with suffering,<br>even if it is just loneliness, I encourage you to bring in all the other books, especially their narrated versions into your place of worship.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way out of suffering, the way towards meaning,<br>is found in Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not disgrace the memories of people who were murdered or tortured by the hands of your organization of choice,<br>to do them justice and correct history's mistakes, your places of worship should become Great Libraries of Wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Suffering, is best prevented,<br>or risen from - not lived in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I worry that that the elderly are being taken advantage of,<br>that the world has abandoned them - most don't need fantasy, they need a job that is respectful of their skills, and a happy outlook.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It seems to me that all the churches are doing for the elderly, is take whatever little money they have left a dollar at a time,<br>it is time to transform your organizations and help the elderly to long and happy futures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The final subject I mention in this text,<br>is Climate and Animals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World poverty has blinded us,<br>there isn't a single person on planet earth that would wish famine and pandemics on the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in poverty,<br>the energy withing us that cares about all the future generations, that projects our love thousands of years into the future - has been drained, and we can no longer see that far.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Not only have we added to destabilized the climate<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>we have done nothing to take care of it for future generations - we will not be forgiven for this, the scientists are warning of untold suffering.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>There maybe as few as 2,154 tigers left<sup>[6]</sup></span>, no generation wants to lose a species or large animal,<br>looks like our generation has destroyed the tigers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We did this,<br>with out fake education, our busy live, arrogance & ignorance, and all this hard work under a state of made up, bullshit problem, that could have been avoided, the problem of world poverty draining us of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Become a teacher, make your voice heard around the world and well into the future, make a difference, begin now,<br>the children and the future generations need a real education so that they may grow in Knowledge, Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.</div>
