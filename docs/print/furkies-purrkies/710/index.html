    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thing to do is to learn for real,<br>learn things that provide results despite education's faults.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is something rotten within the state of school,<br>and that is just not very cool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They should teach you programming and digital art,<br>doing anything else is not very smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it <strong>is; all</strong> about, becoming smart,<br>because we're all stuck in poverty; and need a better start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So Get Krita and buy a pen and tablet, and art,<br>art until you become smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you <strong>must</strong> practice first,<br>because the thing keeps coming out cursed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Start with your own selfie,<br>and set your creative powers free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here's a good piece of advice,<br>practice until you feel comfort capturing eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because as bobbleheads go,<br>that is all you really need to know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is up to you if you start with lovely people first,<br>or bobblehead all the worst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though you should know that you maybe able to fix a bully with art,<br>seeing kindness, will often make them smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you should definitely do the teachers,<br>so pay good attention to all their features.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If Ms. Shcovid, asks you "Are you counting my enormous moles?"<br>just say "Yes, that's <strong>one</strong> of my goals.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Paint her caricature and put a fair price on the T-Shirts you print out,<br>and make every dollar count.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when they accuse you of being immature,<br>just ask "Are you sure?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then surprise her with a 3D printed bobble head,<br>and tell her its nickname is bonehead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because a teacher that does not encourage art,<br>is by definition, not very, smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whether you learn Ender, Blender, <strong>and</strong> Krita is up to you,<br>but the more you know the closer you are to the next breakthrough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">2D Painting and 3D Modeling as in learning for real,<br>is a <strong>very</strong> big deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to learn by cramming for tests,<br>can only line the pockets of greedy pests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you think you love art so much,<br>that you face failure and such.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you are in great luck,<br>because now you can make a movie about how you got unstuck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what broken schools do,<br>they make you stuck in a kind of glue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Incompetent people destroyed High School,<br>thus, if you let it it may turn you into a tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to escape all efforts at crushing you,<br>because you need a real education too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you make a secret documentary about fake education,<br>you can absolutely, move a nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But even better than that, is a series of programs,<br>that expose the fake everything from crappy textbooks to dumb down exams.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make the principal fear your film crew,<br>make his stomach churn and turn at the sight of you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then keep filming, exposing all the in-authenticity,<br>until you fix, not just yours but every city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whether you have a 4.0 or barely pass,<br>know that graduation does not make for greener grass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact mostly fake graduation,<br>has the power to undo even your greatest aspiration.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bottom line is that fake or broken schools,<br>can only manufacture broken tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake schools can only make for meaningless graduations,<br>ergo, cramming for useless tests does not deserve congratulations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to face this fact,<br>and you need to act.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't just blow four years on half memorized formulas and a worthless diploma,<br>as that is lite more than having spent them in a coma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to independently reach out for real education,<br>even if just by constantly listening to great books with fine narration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education wise,<br>is the least you can do - it is best... that you rise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Art is about rising straight off the bat,<br>thus, the most beautiful form of doing just that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It won't be about any one of your works in particular,<br>but about the fact that each and every one of them was extracurricular.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's how broken the schools are,<br>it is not about the piece of paper, but burning it brightly ... like a star.</div>
