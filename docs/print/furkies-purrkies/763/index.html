    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, I gave myself <span>20 minutes to paint something<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and I am not happy with what I created.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am pretty sure if you do a 20 minute speed painting session,<br>you are not going to be too happy either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However,<br>how...everrr...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Speed painting is important especially,<br>when using a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are given access to each and every detail there is.<br>We are artistic royalty, gushing with perfection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, for the sake of study,<br>of comprehension of greatness...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to let the paint do the painting,<br>that is what impressionism is about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Capturing in some kind of glorious desperation,<br>all the most important details, and then setting the brush down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I’ve learned that ears are not too important,<br>that nose, does not need to be perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That, lips do need extra work,<br>and of course eyes are the most important feature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I also learned that both Hyperrealism and<br>Impressionism are perfectly valid ways of creating a painting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still believe that portraits of real individuals,<br>need to be Hyper-realistic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just don’t want people to be surprised,<br>by the girth of brush strokes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I want them to be surprised<br>with a perfected stylized likeness that no photo could ever capture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But I am certain that if impressionism was denied to us,<br>if we lived in a Universe where it is looked down upon or illegal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We wouldn’t be able to sleep at night,<br>we’d be hard at work breaking the rules and loving the works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first time I saw an impressionist paining,<br>I said to myself that I am looking at a color map.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the first impression it was a paint-sketch,<br>carefully marking where all the colors, and shapes go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, that the world considered it a complete work,<br>simply meant to me...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the step one to creating a paining,<br>is an art in it self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I am unhappy with today’s creation,<br>I know deep down, that for all its flaws, it is complete.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can we allow ourselves to create a series of nine impressionist works,<br>and call it done?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, but you won’t be able to appreciate it completely,<br>until you do it in a single sitting, in a single afternoon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Carefully prepare nine photo references first,<br>perhaps from unsplash or reddit gets drawn, but you should take your own photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it will probably take a bit over three hours,<br>as it is three paintings per hour, but there are always details we miss in haste.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes little to add them,<br>but they make an enormous difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then, put them on a memory stick,<br>and run like the wind to get them printed out and immediately put them up on a wall in a coffee shop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(You might want to ask for permission first,<br>but if nobody is looking...)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A <span>nearby supermarket<sup>[2]</sup></span> may offer 8x11 prints on standard paper,<br>for just about three bucks, and a dollar store could get you some nice frames for just about a dollar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to sign your works, to make it official,<br>just price the series at a $1,000 dollars, negotiable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take some photos for your portfolio, and get some rest,<br>as all that will make for a pretty colorful day.</div>
