    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Cat Pea Technique is working as well as it should,<br>and I just now found a <span>tracing demo showing the Reference Images Tool<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here a person is tracing the shapes of musical instruments,<br>through a transparent reference image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know if it is mentioned that the color picker tool,<br>will pick original colors from the reference image even though it has been made transparent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This tool is both for tracing shapes,<br>and picking the correct colors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A lot of people ridicule the idea<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br><span>others ridicule people that ridicule the idea<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Discouraging people from art, is a very toxic thing to do<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>so this fantastic art technique, also doubles as method for detecting all the elitist, bat shit crazy monsters in the room...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to tell someone that they are not an artist,<br>it is like asking someone to quit laughing - art is a very important part of the Human Condition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all else; this meowwrvelous technique is a REAL teacher,<br>because <span>the more you work with it the more you will be able to handle<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You simply become more curious about art,<br>the more you learn about it, for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now onto the review,<br>of the first steps I took.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea that all my artworks should be square,<br>in part because I can make a bigger and more interesting square with each nine works - works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you absolutely need a rectangle,<br>use up six of your squares, a 2x3, this way you can still continue the tile work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will enhance your portfolio,<br>and if you make your coffee book, or art-book square, it will absolutely add to the beauty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My idea of using animator pink as a background color,<br>may not be so good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would still encourage considering such an exploit,<br>but also caution that if you invest yourself in keeping to a single background color...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">None of your works can touch the edge of the canvas,<br>especially the bottom edge as the case is with portraits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I finish a portrait I want to share it with the world,<br>I don't want to search for a photo of a frame or a graphic motif to prevent the work from touching the edges.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My caricature or low-brow art style creation system works,<br>I used it twice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But realistic portraits are so much more beautiful,<br>that I can't bring myself to do caricatures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I did discover that once you paint a realistic portrait,<br>it is then very easy to extend it into the world of low brow pop surrealism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is more respectful, however, to just give the person their painting,<br>without messing with any of the shapes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So a caricature or a low brow piece; is a secondary work of art;<br>think of it as a cute companion to the full portrait - it is sure to make the subject smile.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now onto the stylization components,<br>where we enhance photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all know that putting a little white reflection dot in the eye, makes it look more realistic,<br>but you should also add a transparent layer reflecting something like the sky of pavement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The shape of this reflection should probably be circular,<br>in one of my works it actually has the shape of bushes that are reflected in the animal eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond the reflection of the light,<br>there is also a mirror image reflected by the eyeball, and you don't need to stop there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For one you can add more light, and you don't have to have that light,<br>mess with shadows in other parts of the painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Create art for beauty's sake<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>not to be technical.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Skin has reflections too, and the best place to see that is 3D models in blender,<br>the highlight occurs at the tip of the nose, cheekbone, lip, upper lip, forehead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be mindful of it when searching through other people's art,<br>once you begin noticing it, adding it into your own works will become second nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It makes the digital portrait come alive,<br>and if it does not work for your client, you can always turn it off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Explore selective focus and tilt shift effects,<br>when painting on a physical canvas you have to commit to certain things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't explore past a certain point,<br>because there are points of no return, where you can't click undo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a digital canvas,<br>you can blur a layer to see what happens.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am currently learning fabric folds and,<br>using sunlight with darker or dim photo-reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easier than it sounds, and like my caricatures,<br>I will assemble everything in GIMP via photo editing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is also an area of painting where I will apply a custom color-theme to paintings,<br>be it changing the color temperature, or using a new palette.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is firmly seated in a sturdy photo reference foundation,<br>there is still no chance of getting stuck here...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is light and color here,<br>that is not of this world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Again, you are an artist, stretch a transparent reference image over your canvas,<br>and let it take you on an adventure towards worlds and universes of your own creation.</div>
