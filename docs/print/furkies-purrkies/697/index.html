  <div class="paragraph">Do not stop,<br>do not let anybody or anything stop you from growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a danger lurking here,<br>because well wishing people will try to cut you off from your future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It almost always works too,<br>you hear people quietly mutter “I can't, I can’t I have a job now”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A boy turned to a 62 year old balding man, who never smiles,<br>wondering where he lost his youth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Youth is lost by not growing all the way up,<br>by not standing up for who you are.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It happens when we get tricked into giving up,<br>we then stop rising, and maybe even fall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are not allowed to become our parents, or older siblings,<br>or anyone from the older generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are not to travel the roads of the previous generations,<br>we must grow from where they left off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All it's all for,<br>naught!</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Their false advice, is not their fault,<br>they got cut off too.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Please,<br>understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you have a precious right,<br>to rise all the way up, in Knowledge and Wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes little more than a Library and a Park Bench, but I hope your starts are better,<br>it always works out in the end, your brilliance id to our dark ages as oxygen to the earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fight for your path in Life and the Universe,<br>because you can’t rewind back your life, and try again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't get mad, don't be sad,<br>simply travel your unlimited steps.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This is the beginning,<br>this is not how things are meant to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Universe has just burst out of the singularity,<br>the stars that we see, are the initial sparks of that explosion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The universe will last for a long time after all the stars fade out,<br>the stars are just the beginning.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">That Humanity in its collective incompetence born of lack of experience,<br>chose to power the world with stupid Poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Must have no bearing on your brilliant life,<br>as day will come when World Poverty will end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will look at out dirty hands; Pollution, Climate Change, Suffering, War,<br>extinction of the Tiger, Giant Panda, White Rhinoceros, Sumatran Orangutan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And poverty will end,<br>with a simple piece of plastic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And on that day, you are not to stand uneducated,<br>you are to stand a great being, and travel unlimited steps.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The fantasy <strong>is</strong> that Humanity wants to be poor,<br>so that it is moved by the threat of hunger and the park bench.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fantasy <strong>is not</strong>,<br>the Universal Income card,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The stupid idea of working our way out of poverty<br>will eventually become extinguished.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever is built on top of the bubble of wage slavery,<br>will implode and cease to exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the technological interconnectedness of the people,<br>that will imbue humanity with the necessary wisdom to see it self outside of wage slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are to stand proud,<br>on the day that Humanity will begin advancing at the pace, that is worthy of it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There are no more sacred things in the universe<br>that a life lived without bowing down to other peoples mistake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not the reason why poverty exists,<br>you are not the reason for anybody else's poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you are not the answer to their cries of poverty,<br>you are not property, you are not a slave, you are not to wash feet, and your life is your own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever you are born into,<br>is probably all wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will find the correct observations, answers, and directions,<br>across a thousand of the world’s most beloved-and-life-changing books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to reach out on your own,<br>your education is your own responsibility.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Blindly trusting and following other peoples' good intentions, and paths less traveled by, high school and college, all all the other half measures,<br>will only indoctrinate you to accept massive loans, and meaningless jobs or careers, that will make you old and weak.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You are to rise outside of, any and all, invisible prisons walls,<br>and you are not to stop cure the lepers in other peoples heads.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is nowhere as developed as we think it is,<br>as beautiful as our days, the dark ages, have not yet come to a close.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is not your fault,<br>it is not your fault.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you are our light, our hope,<br>and you are our dream of a bright future.</div>
