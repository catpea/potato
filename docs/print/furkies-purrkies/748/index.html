    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone of us has the responsibility to stand for truth,<br>to stand authentic, and un-freaking-breakable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sticks and stones may break my bones,<br>but words will never hurt me."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we allow ourselves to get broken,<br>then three will be no future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't expect those doing the breaking,<br>to create any future, they can only feed on destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we are not animals in the terrible sense of the word,<br>we are still Great Warriors, it is our heritage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I repeat not a single student, or dreamer, or geek, or beautiful loser, or the <strong>truly beautiful</strong> cursed to never see it that way,<br>is allowed to retreat into their room, into their depression, and darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it loss, or tragedy, or because some hollow creature,<br>did or said something cruel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hollow,<br>or the unfortunate that bullies turn to bullies... for hate can only spread.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Can't really remember you,<br>and even if they could, they live in a crumpled piece of paper universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tragedy of a bully, aside from the harm they cause, is that - for as long as they live in their sorry state,<br>their time in life has already passed, maybe short of some flicker in their final days.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In a way, those who feel pain, or dread, or fell hurt,<br>and never do the hurting - are being called to greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because those who cause harm to the beautiful,<br>can't perceive futures and thus can build.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you understand,<br>if the hurt don't rise - there is no future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hurt,<br>are the only hope.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It may come as a surprise,<br>it certainly comes as a surprise to many.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That Ariadne has left a string for us all,<br>we don't even have to reach for it, you just need to touch your index finger to your thumb.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And imagine you are holding a brush,<br>the string is art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yes there is a problem,<br>yes there is a problem with the on ramp.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because in dread,<br>you can't get the colors right, in dread the shapes will slide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is not a problem of the soul of an artist,<br>this is a mechanical problem with the way we hold the brush on our out of darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You mess with computers a little bit, you install Krita,<br>you stretch the image reference over your entire canvas and make it transparent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now no matter how hard it is to hold the brush,<br>no matter how hard it is to see through the tears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have your colors,<br>and you have your shapes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in three, five,<br>or whenever you are satisfied with your perfect portraits and finally convinced you were an artist all along...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will let go of the realistic colors,<br>because you will know better - nay - you will neeeeed better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need more sunshine than a reference photo could possibly hold,<br>and the temperature of your work will have to match the temperature of the color in your best visions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just about at the same time,<br>you will need better shapes too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By making the eyes bigger, you make the painting speak more, by adding a touch of fish-eye perspective, you can lean your subject into the space of the person looking at it,<br>and by that time you will have memorized how to paint the eye ten times over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, your soul will pour your own special color into your works,<br>and your touch will speak with larger eyes, and that edge of sunlight, and the cheek bone highlight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art is here for all of us, whether it calls to you or not, know that you are an artist,<br>You Are An Artist.</div>
