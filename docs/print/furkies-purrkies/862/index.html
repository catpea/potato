    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to make money from programming all by yourself,<br>because the products you compete against are made by multiple people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect most times, you are up against a startup that didn’t take off,<br>so there is four people with nothing to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only the huge startups that require money to stay afloat shut down,<br>the small clever ones transform and evolve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, they will see that they have failed, and look at the good decisions they made,<br>things they bought that really worked for them despite their failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it will just make sense,<br>to start producing those things for other startups.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here failure makes them strong, and mature,<br>it gives them powerful optics, clear vision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by contrast, as fancy as their original idea was,<br>it now becomes a bitter sweet embarrassment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Usually the lesson they take away,<br>is do one thing well, and make sure customers are already waiting and willing to pay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In other words, they begin fixing problems,<br>that people have, and are ready to pay for.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes programmers will hire other programmers,<br>especially if they are in country with a weak economy where code costs less per line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As ordinary as a group of friends,<br>making a startup is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lone programmer,<br>is the opposite.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are a force of chaotic good, perfectly impenetrable genius,<br>and a <span>Niagara fall of raw and unrefined creativity, unleashed<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But by far, the most intimidating side of their personality,<br>is a <span>sense of humor<sup>[2]</sup></span>, that has ages ago <span>surpassed anything and everything<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fuel behind their power, is the time,<br>their company pays for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A proper corporate programmer, works less than an hour a month,<br>and <span>it is considered a total failure to do any work at all<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Contrary to the stories, they don’t surf the internet,<br>that’s what news people writing these articles do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They build, they program, they invent, they solve impossible challenges,<br>they refine their skills, and they become a silent and invisible force of nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thousands of their computer programs are scattered across multiple accounts,<br>most of which they no longer care about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And although the code is hard to read,<br>and may mix tabs and spaces, it is as genius an anything by world renowned scientists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They just don’t give a s*it about rewards,<br>they like the challenge it self.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You will find it difficult, though not impossible to compete against them,<br>usually though, you just send them a cake, as a sign of respect and recognition.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This is where you start,<br>among the Great Hackers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Programmers so capable,<br>that they first laugh at the word hacker, and then they reinvent it to adorn themselves with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your tools must be on point,<br>everything you do must be wise, and your choices, impressive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The path ahead of you if nothing short of enlightenment it self,<br>so it is hard to make mistakes here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Simply choose the greatest challenges,<br>and let them grant you powers to smash the ones that you once thought impossible.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Choose the most popular programming language,<br>that will not slow you down with data types and memory management.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today and for foreseeable future that language is JavaScript,<br> it is often made fun of by people who chose the wrong languages to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Choose the hardest challenge,<br>that is well within your grasp, and goes in harmony with your programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Choose Code Generation as your mightiest challenge,<br>with friends or no friends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Code generation is a great teacher,<br>and it holds the promise of helping you automatically generate products for sale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The idea behind code generation is simple,<br>most of the code that is written is just fluff and boilerplate to glue all the pieces together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With code generation you just focuses on the important parts,<br>leaving all the boilerplate to the generator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Code generators use simple template engines<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>I recommend using <span>ejs<sup>[6]</sup></span> as it allows you to use plain JavaScript to manipulate JavaScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are advanced techniques such as parsing the JavaScript Abstract Syntax Tree,<br>but that introduces far too much complexity, for the results it brings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Sweet.js<sup>[7]</sup></span> is a nice example of interacting with the AST,<br>though it is somewhat off topic here.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to what code to generate, at least at first,<br><span>website themes<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The advantage of using a code generator,<br>is that you should be able to easily update your code as the underlying libraries change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least, working on generating products, that are ready for sale,<br>is a great motivator for learning programming with JavaScript.</div>
