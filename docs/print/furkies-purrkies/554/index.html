  <div class="paragraph">Without your writings poetry will die,<br>you are a poet, and that is not a lie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't create to fit a poem or a chapter, or a flap of wings,<br>your creation comes <strong>first</strong> and actually redefines those things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your treasures are not defined by what fits some particular box,<br>but how you create and share <strong>new</strong> and <strong>original</strong> building blocks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Completing other people's thoughts, unraveling their delusions,<br>and maybe even preventing the spread of illusions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A book means nothing if written by a robot that can't feel,<br>the Human is the foremost, that's what makes the poem it real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is time for you to begin to write,<br>every day, one sentence, by twilight.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can write on your hand with a pen,<br>but you will want a journal to save it every now and then.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are already a poet right now,<br>you don't need to know how.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was in you all along,<br>and it is lifelong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All you need to do to write,<br>is to chain the words that fit right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Keep it as short as you can,<br>that's the best plan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stanza by stanza it will all add,<br>and you'll have your first poem in your notepad.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Rhyming is actually quite ordinary,<br>just need a <span>rhyming dictionary<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your wisdom is the big deal,<br>growing wiser is the poetry's appeal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the people you write to,<br>is the elder you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every one of your rhyming lines,<br>eventually create lifelines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow wiser and stronger,<br>your poems will become longer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is best that you start right now,<br>let your dreams show you how.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Poetry is the real jewelry and ink;<br>it helps you think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It helps your grow,<br>it helps your remember all the things that you know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every poem you write,<br>will eventually become someones light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the thoughts that you think you don't need to write down,<br>that prevent others from being knocked down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No thought has ever been too little,<br>no word has ever been too brittle.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But there is more to it of course,<br>poetry is also an expression of your life force.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right at the center of your being,<br>lies the power of seeing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your goodness, wisdom, authenticity, sight,<br>give you unbrekability and infinite might.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poetry reaches beyond any and all limitations,<br>as it can last for countless generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ideas you write down today,<br>will change the world someday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone gets to have their say,<br>so write in your own way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because poetry was in you all along,<br>and you are plenty strong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May you never forget and forever know,<br>that your words are meant to help Humanity Grow.</div>
