      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">What Is In A Programming Language Anyway?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Variables<sup>[1]</sup></span>, <span>functions<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>if statements<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>loops<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>objects<sup>[5]</sup></span> to group variables and functions together into a structure that makes sense to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, my if(app.user.loggedIn()){app.navigation.signOutButton.visible = true}</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So computer programming,<br>is super simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you stick to one programming language,<br>like latest modern JavaScript it is even simpler.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is just about variables that you define,<br>which hold things that yo use, like serverAddress = “example.com”;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If statements that you use on your variables,<br>like if user.loggedIn then redirect(‘/home’);</div>
  <div class="paragraph">functions that you call,<br>which most often return variables.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You usually create a lot of function for yourself,<br>and they represent the shape of the program you are writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are building a virtual world or a <span>MUD<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>then you will have a function that says player.go(‘north’);</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or better yet, room.connect(‘north’, universe.createRoom(‘Bathroom’));</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many of the tiny functions come from your operating system,<br>so like open(‘letter.txt’) is something that the programming language creators let you have.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a wrapper function, for the operating system’s,<br>open file call.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The programming language it self will bring in a lot of functions,<br>one of the coolest and most forbidden functions in JavaScript is eval().</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is often said that it is evil,<br>so I am not going to tell you about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some variables are actually groups of variables,<br>groups are a big deal in programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can use a group variable to store,<br>a bunch of urls that you then download and convert to plain text.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way you can simplify your news,<br>and just get the plain text version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If statements have a sister, that comes in useful here,<br>and that is the loop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you can say, I will loop over my list of urls,<br>and call some functions like downloadUrl(), and then convertToText().</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Functions can also be grouped,<br>and that is where you hear this “dot” a lot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not make sense to put functions in a sequence,<br>like a list of news adresses for download...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you throw them in a bag,<br>like a generic group.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The word bag is something I just use here,<br>to show you that it is just this generic thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this would just be another variable,<br>in your program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The correct name for bag or generic group,<br>is object.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Things get pretty fuzzy here,<br>because why stop at putting functions in a bag...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why not say:<br>user.name = “Alice”;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The dot actually comes from the world of<br>Object Oriented Programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In JavaScript you can have a ban like object,<br>where you don’t have to define it first or create a new instance of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is just the short hand notation,<br>for the underlying object.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you would want to use it so that you can have two variables names user1 and user2,<br>and user1 can be alice, and user2 can be bob - without overriding anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A more realistic example is where,<br>you have a list of users like in a spreadsheet, which is what a database is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a spreadsheet your data automatically updates,<br>in a database, you create lots and lots of sheets and then join some of them when needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here rather than thinking sheets,<br>you think in rows of data, where each row represents a user.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often people go extra step,<br>and setup a useful user object for each row.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can have a databaseRows.find(‘username’, ‘alice’);<br>which then returns a user object that would have some useful functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So databaseRows, for more often database.query(),<br>fills the user object out for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you were programming a MUD, or a virtual world,<br>you would define an object named room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then dream up what your room objects should be about,<br>do you want your rooms to have a .go() function which moves the player through some door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or do you want your user to have a user.go() function,<br>what sounds better for you?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What if you want to move a chair,<br>do you want to write a go function for a chair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or move function for the room,<br>or an inventory bag or object, that you attach to the user.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where they can put their chair in their inventory,<br>then say player.go(‘living room’), and player.inventory.drop(‘chair’)?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Building out Objects with functions,<br>can be like building a universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So objects and lists, are like a higher level grouping mechanism,<br>for variables and functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where functions can call other functions,<br>often based on if statements testing some variable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you do have a list then you use a loop,<br>to apply some function to each of the items in the list.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And often in that function you have lots of if statements,<br>and call other functions, maybe do some more looping.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is this funny thing where people call HTML a programming language,<br>technically it isn’t, but those people don’t usually understand why.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So HTML has these nested tags, and each tag can have attributes,<br>and in most cases you close the tag.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So all this actually represents a hierarchy of objects,<br>all the tags have corresponding object, and tag attributes are applied to those objects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You could create a tag named user,<br>with attributes name and email.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the reason why HTML is not a programming language,<br>is that it is used to create a deeply nested hierarchy of variables.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just like the variable creation part of a language,<br>converting tags to objects my be sometimes called hydration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because tags in their text form,<br>are like this dehydrated object hierarchy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inventions like <span>svelte<sup>[7]</sup></span> mix logic and loops with HTML,<br>so svelte’s markup is almost almost a language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a <span>templating language<sup>[8]</sup></span>, because templating HTML,<br>is not really thought of as programming, templating often does not understand tags and sees text instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are going to learn a language learn JavaScript,<br>because it helps you program windowed applications with electron, on the server with node.js, and in the browser alongside HTML and SVG.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">HTML allows you to include a code editor in your program,<br>and SVG and canvas allow you to manipulate graphics, including <span>3D graphics<sup>[9]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To pull in all those technologies together in C, Java, or Python, or PHP,<br>may not only represent a lot of work, but outdated or old libraries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to whether or not you should consider learning programming,<br>knowing programming is like having a smartphone, it is the new standard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the young people will eventually know it,<br>but the previous generations still can be <span>Hip Hop!<sup>[10]</sup></span>, without the damn thing.</div>
