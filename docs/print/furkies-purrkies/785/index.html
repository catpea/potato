  <div class="paragraph">There actually is,<br>a good use for drawing <span>simplified models<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where you draw a face model on your source image,<br>mark all the distances, and make all the relative measurements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then repaint the super-simplified model again,<br>but this time on your empty canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This technique also works for the body,<br>there you will mark knees and joints and shoulders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And again repaint the model you drew over the photo,<br>on a blank canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all you have is a photo,<br>canvas and traditional brushes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Turn your photo into a line-reference model,<br>and draw the same geometric contraption on your canvas to get started.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If I ever had a portrait pained of me,<br>I would ask the artist not to do that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would like them to use their good judgment on a silly and fascinating warp transform,<br>and then use that as use direct reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slightly warped or not, I would like to see my <span>real face<sup>[2]</sup></span> not something that is a try,<br>I want them to get it right, and have fun while painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And why would I want them to draw little line models, first,<br>that will only cause unnecessary distortion.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We can't forget that a proper or perfect likeness,<br>is a <span>small potato<sup>[3]</sup></span> in relation to all the other things that should be going on in the painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An artist may already begin by taking over the eyes,<br>and making them glow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then move on to a Suit of Armor,<br>and weapons, a battle, a star ship, mars, wings, something... something interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I am not sure if I would ever request a portrait,<br>I like things that I create on my own.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Portraits are special because <span>Lady with an Ermine<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>was the first work of art that I understood as such, wham I was little.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think I am a fan of big scenes,<br>and painting those has also benefited from modern technologies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>3D Modeling<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>is a wonderful way to map out a complex scene.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would really enjoy building a world,<br>with architecture and characters, maybe a fancy monster, or a dragon, up close.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the while tracking the one angle,<br>that I would paint this world from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A 3D printed world is a neat companion for a painting,<br>that displays all the action and emotion.</div>
