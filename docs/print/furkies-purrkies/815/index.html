      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Computer Based Government</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Times are going to change within the next hundred or two hundred years,<br>we are just beginning to understand that there are nations that are ran by crime families.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Under the stress of Climate Change and all the things that come along with it,<br>these fantasy governments will fail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than facing an uncertain future where people who caused the failure,<br>can buy their way back into leadership.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your generation,<br>will need to provide certainty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that certainty can be achieved,<br>by using voter driven software in place of politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not an easy computer program to build,<br>and it has to rely on reality rather than wishful thinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is still powered by minds of humans,<br>but it will also ask the voters if laws once put in place are still important.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If decisions that were previously made are still good enough,<br>if things need to stay, if things need to be rebuilt or re-thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a flexible and adaptive government system,<br>that will resist corruption by the small minded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It can assure that whatever leaders are elected,<br>will instantly and permanently loose those positions if their promises are broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as there are borders in the world,<br>all the people within a border must count.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But their vote must scale,<br>with their knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all born equal, yes,<br>but some people in their un-education will act against their best self interest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People can be easily mislead by a handful of criminals,<br>into believing that universal basic income would be bad for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they will vote against it,<br>they may even violently fight against it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The core of a stable computerized government is education,<br>the paths towards having their vote count will be right before them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one will be denied to make informed decisions,<br>but misinformed decisions, won’t count for much.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Automated schools that teach wisdom, science, reality, authenticity,<br>can be built into the government program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The system can be written well, free of darkness, and heartlessness,<br>and it can easily be made to resist corruption.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are leaving you with multiple nations armed with nuclear weapons,<br>and while today a large scale deployment is of low probability.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Times change, and as new generation inherit filthy ideas,<br>notions such as mutually assured destruction will begin to fade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Short of disarmament, someone will all to soon say,<br>“I used them because that is what they are for.”</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A fully computerized government is still a very strange idea in my time,<br>but it is the only way the world can come together in peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though it sounds horrible that the computer will not count votes equally,<br>it will do a much better job taking care of each individuals within a border.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will equally present opportunities, equally divide resources,<br>and present programs such as learning for cash-rewards, and universal basic income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example where the 13th amendment makes every criminal a slave, this computer program, would see people hurt by poverty,<br>who need a new home, a universal income they can trust to be there forever, and more education, hope, and strength.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The program will continue teaching all,<br>as we are all too easily mislead, when it is left up to humans to lead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The computer will continue helping all of us understand<br>that we are each to rise, and rise, to no end.</div>
