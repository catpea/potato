    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An Art Show is a few days,<br>of where you make your art speak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can make it yell,<br>you can make it whisper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can make it relevant,<br>or it can be totally retro.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please, understand,<br>being shy is beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you will be beautiful,<br>for being shy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no such a thing,<br>as a bad art show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will stress,<br>that everything needs to go into your portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I hate to say it, while this is not completely true, even your elder-self agrees:<br>"If it is not in your portfolio it didn't happen.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So take all the pictures,<br>put them in neatly organized directories and back them up into multiple cloud services.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that once your hard drive dies, and it happens every few years,<br>nothing will be lost, other than a few minutes of your time as you replace it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Sunaura Taylor's website<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>is a nice example of what your website should contain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But do keep the JavaScript to minimum,<br>and setup https, at the time of writing GitHub Pages seem a OK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My first art-show took 12 hours to setup,<br>and that included painting all the art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used a projector,<br>canvas paper, couple of canvas, I did not use frames.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just hung everything up at a coffeehouse,<br>and took it down a week or two later.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I didn't intend to sell anything,<br>I had one sale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It frightened me,<br>because people that pay for my art seem suspicious.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had labels describing the meaning of my art,<br>I wanted to share the meaning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Previously, I invented (or probably independently invented)<br>a new kind of Art Form, I called it Content Art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means that there is a lot of content in the piece,<br>diagrams, mind maps, poems, and little codes that you can scan to go to websites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Life got busy and I never had a Content Art show,<br>it evolved in a Symbolic Language that I would like to use in an educational setting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Basically students have to create concept maps that help them through a game,<br>that consists of rooms, libraries, worlds - it is a school that teacher for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every concept map is a mini game,<br>that unlocks doors and futures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that way, I guess,<br>I am yet to have that art show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What I have here for you,<br>is also a challenge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am challenging you top create a series of Minimalist Content Art pieces,<br>for your first extremely outrageous, on topic, and if you want to to be Guerrilla art show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Guerrilla Art shows,<br>is where you exhibit your art by just putting it up in places where it is seen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it is taken down,<br>sometimes you put it up again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, people take your art home,<br>and it makes them cry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes they become free,<br>sometimes they just laugh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing bad ever happens,<br>unless you are as skittish as me about interacting with people that pay you for the damn things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take the money, tell them your house is on fire,<br>and run away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The rules of the challenge are simple,<br>create five to then posters that are inspired by, or directly quote the text below.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK not to come up with your own text,<br>I have put the text below in the public domain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all good natured sarcasm,<br>but I don't like any of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't like talking about negative things,<br>even though, obviously this is all reverse psychology.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The challenge is about creating fake <span>Propaganda Posters<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>that when seen by a person on the street.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or seen hanging in some abandoned office,<br>or nailed to a tree somewhere, or even blown down the street in the wind...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will make the reader, pause,<br>and really take a deep look at what they are saying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The poster,<br>is supposed to make them think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are looking beyond Guerrilla Art,<br>then have a professional print them out, and then put a layer of glass over it, skip the expensive frames.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you want to go 3D,<br>buy some used briefcases, luggage, and create sculptures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The theme of the show would be,<br>evil men who left their briefcases behind, or something similar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be warned, Guerrilla Art and Briefcases Do not mix,<br>you may go to jail or pay an enormous fine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So briefcases are gallery only,<br>and I would set the price at 500 to a 1,000 bucks or your equivalent - it is just cool art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes people will buy your art to befriend you,<br>that is not how friendships work, so be very careful and as suspicious as I am.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So let me formally disclaim the ownership of these texts,<br>so that you have no worries about anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Please Note That The Following Text, is released into Public Domain,<br>For those of you looking for a specific license see <span>WTFPL<sup>[3]</sup></span>"</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Allow me one more note for all the conspiracy lovers,<br>there is no conspiracy to hurt the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There maybe some fools pretending to take credit,<br>but they are not the reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The problem with the world today is lack of real and effective education,<br>from that point on the consequences only compound and complexity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the people that frighten us,<br>are just victims of fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Universal income, where we borrow from the improved future of humanity,<br>and grant each human being a serious amount of money is a critical component of real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In short, a scared, or stressed out, or pressured by poverty person,<br>will not be able to fully develop an urge for respected Peer Reviewed Knowledge, and resulting internal wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is that wisdom born of stable and clean and dependable knowledge,<br>that will assure control over climate change, collapse of ecosystems, loss of species, mass incarceration, nuclear threats, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are nothing like some civilization destined to be forgotten,<br>Science and Wisdom will grow more powerful the more trouble we get into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No political force can ever become greater,<br>than a well meaning scientist with all the evidence right behind her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The improved schools will pose an enormous challenge to liars,<br>they will be required to retake tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The gravity of climate change and repair,<br>is such that the uneducated will be severely limited in their political powers - until they show Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and a Fine Grasp On Reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry, it is just that today Humanity is just a baby,<br>but this century it is destined to become as wise as a mighty and unstoppable teenager - we'll be OK.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To imagine the future, imagine it is 1920 right now,<br>and compare the 20's to the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now bring the magnitude of these changes out of 1920 into 2020,<br>and now by subtle analogy look into the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will all work out OK,<br>but the next century will not begin with ineffective education, as they will know where that shit will lead to now.</div>

  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am very sorry for the serious tone of some of these taglines,<br>but I want you to see that Art is a superpower.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to witness, your posters, altering people,<br>inspiring them, helping them rise, snapping them out of their slumber.</div>

  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In conclusion, to this imperfect list,<br>art shows are a very precious thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they are meant to be protected,<br>never ever, ever, if you can help it, should you ever look back and say - last time I had an art show was 30 years ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be MINDFUL,<br>that each art show must be followed by the next, and you have to keep that promise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You Art Portfolio, will absolutely become a family heirloom,<br>certainly it will be a website, but perhaps it will be a book sold in stores, or a journal you are attached to as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In your lifetime, it MUST be a reminder to continue exhibiting new shows and ideas,<br>and beyond it will be a connection to who you were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I write this in the 2020's by the 50's we may see the first cheap version of a global universal income program,<br>aimed at prevention of mass immigration, animal slaughter, destroying the remainder of the amazon forest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by the 90's we may actually have a prevention program,<br>that is worthy of Humanity, that will be enough for us to take to real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you make your art hint on School Improvements, And Real Education,<br>Authenticity And Honesty especially in Politics...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And about the thing that actually solves Climate Change and Loss Of Species,<br>the Universal Income Card that helps people retain their Dignity and Health,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and creates room for their natural yearning<br>of Knowledge and Wisdom...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will be remembered with smiles, and admiration,<br>with appreciation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a hundred years from now,<br>people will still look back at you, and wish they could talk to you, and be your friend, and be around you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what all art is for, no matter what type,<br>art is for creating a bookmark in the History of Human Kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A bookmark that curious people can turn to,<br>and entertain their curiosities whilst conjuring up your spirit sometimes across centuries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity will be around for a long time,<br>and people will be fascinated with 2000's there will be many-a-meme from the stuff we uploaded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am certain that Pop Surrealism, propaganda posters included,<br>will become the biggest thing since the Renascence.</div>
