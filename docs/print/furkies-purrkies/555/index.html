  <div class="paragraph"><span>People of the World are confused about complex issues<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>even US Congress Members are not getting real answers and are forced to dumb their questions down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin by writing a declaration of human rights,<br>from the perspective of the human, not the organization defining them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">declaration.json can be used to establish a new plateau for Human Rights and help in Advancement of Human Kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The JSON data format expressly states "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.",<br>the world has changed and this has become a real hope that should be adopted by other programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The data approach is inspired by the portability of todo.txt and resume.json,<br>and patterned after Cytoscape.js Elements JSON with which it should keep compatibility.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Editing is inspired by how operating systems manipulate filesystem data,<br>by means of multiple generic commands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To effectively edit declaration.json a set of command line commands must be provided to help with its editing an maintenance,<br>A proper user interface is required for the end user.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage you to consider using 128 bit UUID labels for each node as pictured below,<br>there will be many documents written for many purposes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The document will undergo many changes on many platforms,<br>by many programmers of varying degree of skill, and the UUID approach greatly simplifies multi user editing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Below you will find a sample document describing a user disagreement with bulk data collection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Follow this format to help people reason about complex nested issues that we face today,<br>that we are unable to completely understand without graphs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Provide the user with mind/concept mapping tools,<br>so that they can easy visualize their work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Implement profiles for large documents such as public personal declarations,<br>so that a person is not faced with thousands of questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example declaration.json - a document publicly declaring what the owner agrees/disagrees with,<br>should be simplified with profile combinations such as “Enhanced Human Rights”, or “Enhanced Security and Privacy”, “Enhanced Animal Rights”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each Human Being should aim to poses such a document publically or privatley,<br>companies should present a compatible document with their demands in a way that can be privately evaluated, where all the incompatibilities are listed in perfectly redable single sentence format.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will allow busy and stressed out people to reason about incompatibilities,<br>and help them see elements previously obscured by legal gibberish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should be able to generate dashboards,<br>that help the people track the more dynamic components.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not just the people but also Governments need your help, Congresswomen and Congressmen are unable to get clear answers from companies that engage in unusual practices,<br>this document format will allow them to get yes or no answers prior to congressional hearings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, Your Generations are the Hopes and Dreams of all the previous generations put together,<br>You are meant to grow in Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Become A Great Being.</div>
