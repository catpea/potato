  <div class="paragraph">Programming 3D objects is as important,<br>as Digital Painting, and Music Composition, and Programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And combined with a 3D printer,<br>in less than gadzillion hours you get to hold your creation in your hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is one hecking reward,<br>for learning a new talent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I want to make it clear, don't worry about this if you don't like it,<br>it will come on its own, later - 3D modeling must always be about having fun.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">After a full day in there,<br>I still fell strongly about not doing everything via Node Geometry for Jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything I did today was straight up nodes,<br>but that would be too cruel for making fun jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though, Geometry Nodes are are good for ring sizing,<br>it is neat to make ring variations in all the sizes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jewelry or decorative items are organic,<br><span>they need a flowing bubbly-bobbly seed, to get things going<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now for a pencil box, or wallets, or superhero belts.<br>oh my gosh, Geometry Nodes save months of design work.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Maybe years of design work,<br>it is kind of crazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Printing clothes, or armor has a huge flaw,<br>because you need to know a personâ€™s dimensions...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">BEFORE, you design the Iron Man armor or helmet,<br>or a New Generation Plastic Attire for a Cat Walk in Paris.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But with these geometry nodes,<br>you can design the suit first...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then let it reconfigure it self,<br>just based on a handful of measurements.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wallet, or Superhero-Belt design,<br>requires millimeter precision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This requires spending a lot of time,<br>aligning things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An inset lid, with an outside latch,<br>is not a fun thing to craft.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But with Geometry Nodes,<br>it becomes a matter of simple math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that,<br>the thickness of wallet walls becomes a parameter you can change.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">While none of the documentation I found was useful,<br>internet videos are hard to complain about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately the way to learn from those,<br>is to go along with what they are trying to teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then later come around,<br>and use that knowledge to create what you need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But as a bonus,<br><span>you learn tings in videos that you wouldn't encounter if you had really good documentation<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
