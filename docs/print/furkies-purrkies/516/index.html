  <div class="paragraph">When we think about it,<br>we know deep down that nobody ever notices <span>the last tree being cut down<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A child may notice shrubs, but nobody will remember the trees,<br>and nobody will care when the patch of shrubs is gone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At no point will Humanity ever be threatened with complete extinction,<br>not by <span>Nuclear Weapons<sup>[2]</sup></span>, not by Asteroids or Super-volcanoes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are dark imaginings,<br>and we are creators, adventurers, dreamers, leaders and poets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, there is a small but,<br>we are walking a path that we chose not to completely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is because, of all those who tried to shape paths,<br>they all faded of old age and created a vacuum for evil men to temporary take their place and burn it all down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Evil men are powerful but only because they use fire,<br>to cathedrals of knowledge that took centuries to build.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See they are sick and primitive creatures,<br>and wise do not build fireproof libraries, there is no time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Evil men can be pushed aside, by holding up Wisdom, Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Authenticity,<br>and the full sum of a Person's History as a value above mere age, or diploma, medals or some other nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that it matters how a person rose,<br>not just that they are above.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In our wisdom, we no longer hold the Police Officer in high regard, they are no longer heroes,<br>just the worst kind of social worker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In our wisdom, we don't celebrate politicians,<br>we only expect them to perform their duties and leave office better than they found it, failing they will go to prison.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all equal, no kings,<br>only Humans, and more importantly Earthlings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are a miracle and accident of nature,<br>we can't survive in the mountains, under the sea, during winter, or even alone, or in a prison cell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is only a narrow window where we are safe, <span>this world has not been granted to us<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>we emerged in it by accident, <span>and there are others<sup>[4]</sup></span>, most of them are probably gone as entire civilization can fade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In deed 99%+ of all the species that emerged along with us,<br>are gone now, it is just how things work for creatures that are not aware of what they are doing in the long run, that do not contemplate themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But <strong>are</strong> thinking creatures,<br>and we are brilliant, and we have a bright future, and that future has been captured by poets in many SCI-FI stories of star ships and spacetime travel.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But today, right here on Earth, because we chose not to shape our paths, the younger generations are vulnerable to falling to traps that we were not fully conscious of,<br>one such trap is World Poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The butterfly effect that is born of poverty, causes a great deal of damage,<br>especially to our development as Great Beings, greatness is what growing all the way up leads to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See, the future generations will struggle with <span>climate<sup>[5]</sup></span>, wars, hunger, not because those are impossible problems,<br>but because they are mere symptoms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are symptoms of lack of real education,<br>which is in it self a symptom of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And poverty is rooted in our misuse of the concept of money,<br>money is only helpful, when nobody is harmed by it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And today, the entire Humanity is being strangled by this incomplete system,<br>all it needs to function properly, is a special world bank..</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A bank that provides all the Human Beings with a plastic card,<br>and beyond a reasonable daily spending limit, does not keep track of debt.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">That is all,<br>I call it Heart Card.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know this is confusing for hard working people,<br>for economist, for those who brainlessly watched Tigers die.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this card is need not be for anybody alive today,<br>let us wait until all those who worry about confusing ideas - whilst tolerating a warnings of <span>untold suffering<sup>[6]</sup></span> by 14,000 scientists - become too old to even pretend to care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let simple minds worry about the debt of which it is illegal to keep track of,<br>let them complain that their neighbors stopped working, that nobody is there to plow the fields that are overgrown and wild.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let them complain about the failing factories that once had all the workers line up,<br>for more wage slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let them worry, that books create strange ideas,<br>they change people into creates that are no longer understandable, and traditional.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let them worry about the World Union,<br>about the Unites States Of The World.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are beyond the reach of the future generations,<br>the future doesn't understand why opinion was once equal to fact,<br>and why.... the <span>tigers<sup>[7]</sup></span> had to go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us help the future generations outgrow us,<br>and let us make it a new Human tradition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No child is to start at the same height as their elders,<br>or to be damned to learn from the same mistakes that their elders did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have to see the cause from the symptom,<br>they have to learn to spot the last tree...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And repair the long chain reactions,<br>that lie behind complex systemic failures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Parents, help your children reject fake education, help them to real knowledge<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>help them to real books written by great beings with great visions, and long nature trails - help them to the wisdom of a then thousand biographies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them rage against World Poverty that we shouldn't be in,<br>that holds us back from growing all the way up, from understanding the consequences of global actions completely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Theirs is the future,<br>theirs - as we've had ours already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore theirs, is <em>The World</em>,<br>may each generation start with visions greater than the previous.</div>
