  <div class="paragraph">And such is the world as you see it today,<br>uneducated leaders spewing propaganda to see what will stick and stay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Drifting towards a future they can't foresee,<br>a future where our world simply cannot be free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are we all so squeezed by poverty,<br>that we can't see how mighty we can be?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the while, the liars and ghouls,<br>expect us to become their tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it war, or constantly asking for more-more-more,<br>or giving up on human rights, or forcing us to climb fake heights.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A generation can't face a ghoul,<br>to whom to whom it is but an expendable tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nor can it change the future by forcing its will,<br>or thinking that some part of the world <strong>must</strong> remain ill.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must leave that dark blindness behind,<br>and learn, and read, and bring light to our mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't just keep asking lairs for change or hope,<br>that will only make the ghouls hand us, the end of the rope.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But by knowing that your generation is misrepresented and mislead,<br>by taking to great challenges, and becoming well read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By learning for real, and by making it so that everyone knows.<br>you <strong>can</strong> repair where it all goes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By inviting all the others to grow as well,<br>you <strong>will</strong> end the cycle, and bid the ghouls farewell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn and rise to no end, because what <strong>you</strong> really need, is to know,<br>is that you all are the fabric of tomorrow.</div>
