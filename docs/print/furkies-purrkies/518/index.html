      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">How To Art: From Mona Lisa To Live Portraits</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When working with graphite,<br>identify the darkest parts of your image first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is where you should start with a middle pencil, like B or 2B,<br>don't go too dark, because B pencils can be oily and hard to erase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And don't press hard on your paper,<br>paper is a little miracle, you have to protect it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't scar your paper with indentations because once graphite gets into them,<br>it will be hard to erase without damaging the paper.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the main thing is that the darkest parts of your image,<br>or Mona Lisa's eyes, hold the entirety of the soul of your subject.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why it is so important to actually have hard shadows in your source image,<br>art without shadow, ;leaves out too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of my commissions didn't have shadows,<br>and while it came out perfect, so much more could have been said if I had the shadows.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And mind you, it is not possible to add shadow,<br>our faces actually have multiple looks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The impression people get when looking at you from the side,<br>and when looking at you from the front, cause to two distinct feelings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We actually merge all the different looks,<br>when we befriend a person, we learn to recognize them from all angles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if all you have is a photo, you can't add shadow,<br>you won't be able to re-create the person in the photo, a stranger will come out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are doing fantasy art,<br>adding shadows is nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are shadow reference books,<br>so you just doodle something close.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But remember that art is about teaching,<br>and making friends, and not being stuck at home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy art,<br>is something you would do at work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are out in the real world,<br>you do real portraits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or like now practice your Mona Lisa,<br>it won't take very long to put together a kit that will help you create portraits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The transition to live portraits,<br>is something you just go through without thinking about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need some technology to do your model justice,<br>don't do freehand, you only come close and fluctuate constantly distorting and improving.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A portrait,<br>is a way of recognizing the impossible beauty of another human being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are people who mark milestones for you,<br>each time you capture their beauty, you grow in wisdom and light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to take a photo,<br>probably in a coffee shop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But one that is lit by the hard light of the sun.<br>so it has to be morning or evening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you have to use a <span>pico projector<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>to transfer their beauty to two dimensional paper, which should be huge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the beautiful things about portraits,<br>is that they are basically posters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Posters that that focus on capturing the soul of your Subject,<br>and bring light to their eyes, and lips.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is really helpful,<br>if you snap a photo during sunset, so that the sun will shortly move out of your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry about having a bunch of art equipment with you,<br>you need it to create a fast portrait that does proper justice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be a Photographer, Technologist, a Maverick, a Force of Nature,<br>and a teacher, you have to explain everything that you are doing along the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mount you pico projector above your big Drawing Paper,<br>maybe use a filter to increase contrast of your photo, to get the shadows out first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then be ready, move quickly,<br>listen to your heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use a B pencil, to quickly get the shadows in,<br>and your biggest Tortillon to make them less pencil and more gradient.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you got a hard edge in there somewhere,<br>use an eraser, to re-create it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eyes are the windows to the soul,<br>make sure to bring light to the bottom of the iris, just like Leonardo did for his Mona Lisa.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The parts that seem empty,<br>are empty because there is nothing there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you see an empty shoulder for example, but you still want that angle,<br>ask the person posing to touch their shoulder with their hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But move quickly,<br>explain that most people need to meet up again for a new portrait.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A portrait is an expedition,<br>and not all editions succeed at first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes if you have time you can do multiple sketches scattered throughout the paper,<br>this looks especially nice when you took multiple photos in multiple angles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And remember your signature,<br>mine was just a litter kitty cat with ears perked up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ask if you can keep the photo photos,<br>and make a few more portraits this time for a local gallery.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please whatever you do,<br>don't do art at home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to go outside,<br>half of art is teaching others how to do it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The true connection to art is not the beauty you capture,<br>but all the different things you will learn about yourself, and others along the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is one more thing,<br>always be ready to give some of your kit away to whoever was made speechless by your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Have an unfinished Mona Lisa at hand,<br>some extra pencils, and a mini kit, that you can just gift them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">We are all Born Artists,<br>and we have to remind each other, to no end.</div>
