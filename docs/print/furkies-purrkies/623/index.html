    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometime around 8th grade we should be able to program, paint, compose music, and write poetry,<br>and you can kind of see that is what school classes hint on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can't even imagine what a horrible mess introduction to music composition must be,<br>the the preparations, the quizzes, the attitude of the teacher, the ease with which she follows directions...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In reality, <span>in the real world learning music composition takes just a few hours<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>lmms, the instrument, is free<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your teachers are not evil,<br>they just want to keep their job, and put food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I told my music teacher that she was being unfair,<br>she barked at me with disgust that life is not fair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when the bullies happened to come after me in her class,<br>and I looked at her for help, she turned her face away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She might have been a musical person once,<br>but then the people she listened to destroyed that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Her teachers and parents did not have the right to pretend to teach her,<br>and she did not have the right to allow others to hurt her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And she did not have the right to speak to me that way,<br>and I had the right not to listen to her, or anybody else who tried to convince me I was stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the A student,<br>was a drug addict, and a pig - and he didn't have the right to do this to himself either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not people who are to be blamed for this,<br>the crazy ones are just spinning tops in a game of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not look for anything or anyone to blame,<br>all of this is happening because we are a young civilization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody has the right to think of themselves or others as stupid,<br>but above all I must underline that we can't think of ourselves as stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though teachers are broken,<br>they still pose a massive danger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, it is in their best interest,<br>for you to walk away from their fake lectures, thinking that you were just not smart enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will never find evidence of this,<br>and those who admit it, lost their minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers don't want you to learn,<br>they want you to memorize and pass the tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't think, don't do, just memorize and pass the tests,<br>so that the teachers can put food on their table, and pretend a little that they are helping the world grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>When you walk out of a music class unable to perform the simple task of music composition, it is not because you are not-smart, but because you just got robbed<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>to put it mildly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even the subject divisions are off, it is not possible to learn math in a math class,<br>you learn math by making cool screen savers in <span>p5.js<sup>[4]</sup></span> which is a JavaScript framework.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the class for learning math would be entitled screen savers,<br>and the class for learning music composition would be entitled learning composition in lmms by means of the Ableton tutorial.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Ableton sells a commercial application, it is used by some popular musicians,<br>take their tutorial but but learn lmms, learn free Open Source programs first.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See what defines a class, is a precious skill that you take away from it,<br>something so valuable that you just want to fill a bunch of little notebooks and keep them safe, as you practice, practice, practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many love their little skill so much that they give lectures and speeches,<br>as the case is with <span>Amy Palamountain on Backbone and Marionette<sup>[5]</sup></span>, or <span>Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript by Anjana Vakil<sup>[6]</sup></span></div>

  <div class="paragraph">You should be able to imagine what a sick joke it is to say,<br>I taught them math, or music, but they failed to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to note that failure in your GPA, that influences College, Career, and the stupid Credit Score,<br>crosses beyond dark jokes into pure evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to remember, forever and ever, that there is no such thing as stupid,<br>there are only people who have been misled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the easiest people to mislead are those who lack experience,<br>I had nothing in me when my Music Teacher said that life is unfair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I couldn't tell if this was wisdom or lie,<br>teacher <span>saying such a thing to a young student that she just sacrificed to average out her grades, means she chose not to think or experience life in any healthy way<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means she hates her family, hates her life, hates her job,<br>that she hates the students, and that she hates Mondays; that she is alone and hates everyone for all the bad things they did to her - that's not a teacher, that is a person in need of psychological help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't know this when we have nothing to compare those kinds of people to,<br>we are left to trust that schools teach, and teachers are taking advantage of that, just so that they can put food on their table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">You need four things to get a real education,<br>tutors that know what they are talking about, audio books from the library, fascinating video lectures, and cheerful adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your parents need to hire a series of tutors, not to help you with math,<br>but to independently teach you a large chunk of the field of mathematics, and then help you to hundreds of videos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Same with programming, programming is a microscope that helps you get into everything,<br>it is not something that people do, it is a thing that will be stolen from you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike mathematics programming requires displaying real results, programs,<br>the teachers are of course trying to trick you into accepting test programs, nonsense programs, that nobody uses, but that just reveals the fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tutors, Audio Books, Video Lectures, and Cheerful Adventures,<br>and this has to cover the full range of subjects that a nice person should be aware of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some call it becoming a Polymath,<br><span>a Jack of all trades and Master of Some<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A tutor that teaches their knowledge independent of school,<br>will never grade you, and will only guide you towards the things you are curious about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Focus your Audio Books on biographies about life,<br>because you need to figure out on your own what the teachers are doing to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge leads to Wisdom,<br>and Wisdom will lead you towards greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not forget where you come from,<br>do not forget High School after you graduate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you feel lost in class, ask your older self to think back to that moment, and keep you company,<br>and as you grow keep that promise, return in your thoughts to when you were lost and lonely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in your Greatness,<br>fix it all.</div>
