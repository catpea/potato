      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Rising With Art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are all artists, and powerful learners,<br>it takes hours to paint realistic things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it almost takes no effort,<br>to navigate complex concepts as if they were a city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take a selfie,<br>or a photo of a friend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just use a projector in traditional art,<br>or a transparent layer in digital art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then quickly find a Coffee Shop or a Gallery,<br>to display you art in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there you go,<br>that is all the proof you need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you relax,<br>you will want to paint magical things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Glowing eyes, or swords,<br>shiny armor and stormy vistas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The distance between a realistic portrait,<br>and the much easier bonuses and effects...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is so short and fun,<br>that we probably shouldn't measure it in terms of distance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are problems that can artificially,<br>be put in front of you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that does not mean you are not an artist,<br>that just means you got tricked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, teachers forcing you to practice mixing oil paint,<br>based on color theory, until art bores you is a trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They just want to put food on their table,<br>and they want easy to display proof they are teaching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So they will say "they know color theory now",<br>but that is a fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If your teacher wanted to teach yo art for real,<br>they would just show you to use the damn wall projector in your class room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they fear that, because that will make you ask real questions,<br>like "How to make gold seem heavier", "How to make the clouds seem heavy with rain".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They don't know, they only know how to fake an education,<br>how to quack like the other ducks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are not entirely conscious that they are cheating,<br>same way that you ignore the fact that grades are bull$hit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You know grades don't work, but you tolerate them,<br>like they tolerate selling yo out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bullies are somewhat similar,<br>you know they are the bad guys.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you are still allowing them,<br>to hold influence over you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though they are sick and crazy, and about to fall apart,<br>you are still allowing their laughter to get to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Other artists pose a great danger too,<br>a lot of them will tell you that what you are doing is not art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While, creating more than slightly crooked portraits,<br>and not learning at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers, bullies, jealous artists, crappy people and poverty,<br>will all try to take art away from you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty does it in a pretty vile way too,<br>the myth of the starving artist the beginning of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your art education is fake, your art teacher is fake,<br>you will be told you won't find a job as an artist by the counselor <strong>and</strong> parents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then some seriously creepy ghouls, GHOULS,<br>set a trap for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Check this out, while everyone is pretending college is great,<br>ignoring fake teachers, drug use, and so called sports bars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A bunch of ghouls will give you $100,000 under one condition,<br>you have to pay it even if you file for bankruptcy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But wait there is more, you will get a job,<br>that will not index your raise to inflation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each year as prices go up,<br>you will get a raise that is only a fraction of the yearly inflation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will have to say thank you,<br>for getting paid less each year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I should add war and climate,<br>world government are incapable of advancing the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can only fund war, they can't fund real education,<br>they don't even know education is fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course, they don't know that a Global School,<br>would help the world converge in Wisdom on Peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">None of the rules or laws they crated,<br>are capable to prevent a mass extinction event.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The laws they crafted,<br>can only deal with consequences, not prevention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art is a way to train our minds to reject fake or ineffective things,<br>that lead us in circles, or downright nowhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just the taste of starting int he beginning, all by your lonesome,<br>and then reaching Hyperrealism and beyond.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will help you reject inauthenticity,<br>and begin seeking knowledge be it adventure, narrated books, or documentaries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even before exhibiting your art,<br>you will get angry at having been tricked by teachers, politicians, and common culture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you hold a complete creation in your hand,<br>you will demand the same from school, work and politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the while, and with the now necessary certainty<br>protecting your brilliance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The brilliance that is in all of us,<br>and all to often taken away or traded for something less before we notice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take to art,<br>and use it as a ladder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to narrated books,<br>and inherit the many lifetimes of your favorite authors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From broad knowledge comes wisdom,<br>and wisdom will help you grow, all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until you become a great being,<br>and all the many others too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is the recipe,<br>for the advancement of Human Kind.</div>
