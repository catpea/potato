  <div class="paragraph">Each time you learn something new,<br>new ideas will come and find you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I would venture,<br>that most times artist learn by adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They work on their thing,<br>and when done new ideas spring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they keep going round and round,<br>until all the ideas are found.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And new ideas are found all over,<br>from snowy mountains to a perfect clover.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One may start with doddles, pico projectors and stencils,<br>and suddenly they discover they mastered pencils.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just things they hold in your hand,<br>it is a million things that are unplanned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example sticker slapping,<br>slapping, until all the stickers are overlapping.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is subtle at first,<br>but before long there comes a burst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And then all of a sudden she collecting hey,<br>to mix it real good with her clay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She's building sculptures that dance,<br>and her artworks are all ever France.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She's opened up a time portal,<br>and became admired, beloved and immortal."</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what became a machine for us,<br>was once a work of art of the highest class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a flying balloon, or the loom,<br>or the first computer that filled an entire room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those are all works of art,<br>and it is less about being smart, and more about the heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And art does not stop at what we see,<br>it continues growing like a giant Sequoya tree.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A story is a work of art too,<br>even if all its parts are perfectly true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means regular stories, average ideas, popular inventions, and beautiful daydreams,<br>are a lot more important than it seems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Life! is a work of art as well,<br>and how far that beautiful story goes... no one can ever tell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not into doodles and art,<br>maybe today, is a good day to start.</div>
