  <div class="paragraph">Somehow wisdom got replaced with Movies, Drama, and Music,<br>Local Culture, Family Culture, and School.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We may see strong personalities,<br>but there is little coherence here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We witness,<br>contradictions, limitations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity's aim is to converge on Wisdom,<br>leaving all the bad ideas behind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you get yelled at, controlled,<br>or punched by a bully, you don't punch back, or get mad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You push it all away, <span>swipe and examine<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>know the birth of the universe<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>know your ancestors<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Study knowledge, make your way towards wisdom,<br>and know that the meaning of life is found in Greatness.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The world has problems,<br>our guardians are busy, and the true leaders of the world are the world-and-life changing intellectuals we find in books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one Honest and Authentic will come to you,<br>you have to reach out for your first 1,000 narrated books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to lay to rest the contradictions,<br>inherit the wisdom, and continue searching for more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you graduate higher,<br>the books that were once confusing will begin making sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The books you read or listened to early on,<br>will reveal new treasure as you grow in wisdom and age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more wisdom you contain,<br>the greater your power.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">To jump on the right path as fast as possible,<br>get <span>thick socks, and comfy shoes, and take to Couch to 5K<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In your adult life don't forget about the <span>AT<sup>[5]</sup></span>, <span>PCT<sup>[6]</sup></span>, and <span>CDT<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>as they can restore you, and remind you of your Wisdom and Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin making room in your life,<br>for yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do less of the things that produce no meaningful results in context of life,<br>and do more of the things that are profound, precious, and unbelievable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have a mind as powerful as it gets,<br>and you are a genius, but that is just the first step.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is better that nobody is forcing you to think,<br>and instead you need to put some effort to switch from meaningless to meaningful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a great adventure, just slowly discover the things that create results,<br>do not just believe that a diploma will get you a job, but build your way towards greatness.</div>
