  <div class="paragraph">Humble beginnings in a fancy doodle,<br>a smiley face, or a neighborhood poodle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you take to your first pen creation,<br>and get caught by a teacher to a standing ovation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you push towards your first reference,<br>and make copy by graphite paper your preference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your future will be crowned by many works,<br>as you leave behind all the lying dorks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bright future is right ahead of you,<br>so as long as you keep to your path true.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Pay no attention to experts or moderators,<br>as they quickly become power hungry dictators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just walk your own path as every artist should,<br>and trust that all your works are really good.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each time you create a new thing,<br>you learn something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is how you grow in art,<br>no one is born art-smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With each breakthrough,<br>great ideas will call to you.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Depending on ideas you nurture,<br>you may build enormous ice sculpture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Two inches at a time like a 3D printer,<br>with a 2x4 in color lit winter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or you may model futuristic 3D scenes,<br>but 2D paint all the cities and machines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or print cathedrals to place them on a mossy hill,<br>where you will arrange them and take a misty still.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps it will be music that will touch your soul,<br>and maybe the Berlin School will become your first goal.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever path you take,<br>know what enormous difference teaching others will make.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not forget the doodle you started with,<br>an donâ€™t let anybody turn you into a myth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It deeply matters what you will do,<br>but please remind others that their life is a beautiful work of art too.</div>
