      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Firewall: A Fine Internet Business Idea For High School Students</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Christmas is coming around and internet hackers are buying expensive electronics,<br><span>injecting malicious software into them, and selling them online where companies don't care to verify their authenticity<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Focusing on expensive electronics,<br>is a way of filtering out people that can't afford them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An infected device will will try to hack into other devices on the network,<br>in hopes of escalating privileges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People discover various flaws in all kinds of devices all the time,<br>so if a way to gain access into android phones connected to a local network becomes available in June...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The device that was introduced six months before, will be commanded to hack the phones,<br>though there is plenty of bugs and out dated devices as is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What I describe here is a problem that people have,<br>that is the first step in building a business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Second step is creating something that fixes that problem,<br>and note that big companies are blocked from fixing this problem, as they just want to <span>sell, sell, sell<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as it is not illegal for them,<br>[companies don't care about Human Rights, you, your privacy, or anything else, they only care about profit, profit, profit][2].</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At this point I would like to ask you,<br>to pretend not to care if your robotic vacuum cleaner is hacking your phone and sniffing to all you network traffic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because a problem that you don't care about,<br>is a problem that you shouldn't be trying to fix.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reason for this is failure,<br>a number of strategy, research, development, even marketing failures are coming your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you don't care about what you are trying to fix,<br>these failures will make you tired, they will make you bored, and they will trick you into thinking you have failed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A person who is passionate about a problem, feeds on failure,<br>they perceive failure as a step towards success.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, people who are passionate about fixing a problem,<br>will continuously ask themselves at each step "what if this fails?", "what if this fails?", "what if this fails?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Caring about failure will have a CEO, create smaller failure points, often without thinking,<br>they may take a longer more cautious road, rather than the shorter that appears to lead directly to success.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being passionate about a problem,<br>will cautiously connect a CEO to the solution.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hope you are passionate about your privacy,<br>because here comes the solution worthy of a Wold Class CEO.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A Firewall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is already a firewall in your wireless router, or even your phone,<br>but this is a new kind of a firewall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is designed to show your customers all the outgoing connections,<br>when their phone is getting updates, when their robotic vacuum cleaner is talking to servers in China, when their WiFi app controlled light bulb, calls home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This firewall will block everything by default,<br>that is to say it will stop network communications making all the devices think the internet is down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, a partner website, where all customers can contribute a possible description of what is talking,<br>will provide explanation for all the traffic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot will be talking to Amazon and Google,<br>this is the same problem that Russia had with Signal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This firewall, however, will also feature device fingerprinting,<br>the firewall will see more than an outgoing connection to a random Amazon or Google server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will see that it is the Device identified as the vacuum cleaner,<br>the fingerprinting is only available on the customer's local network.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So this is a firewall that can block google or amazon, or an amazon device from accessing Amazon,<br>the big companies that sell your profile will not be competing against you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, <span>just as soon as list of data breaches on Wikipedia becomes more popular, so will your product<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>it does not matter how many firewall products there are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Many people can't afford expensive routers, so they will use a DIY product similar to Pi-hole<sup>[4]</sup></span> for example,<br>but those who do not wish to mess with networks will pay for the convenience, some a lot some a little.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us go over best of all worlds configuration which is sold as a computer,<br>but there is a free version, that installs exactly like <span>Pi-hole<sup>[5]</sup></span> and requires an existing desktop computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The nicest possible device, is a computer, router, and touch screen monitor in one,<br>this way upon purchase, a person hooks this up to their WIFI or Ethernet, and it becomes a new secure WIFI hotspot, to which all the devices need to be reconnected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The screen will instantly go wild, preventing browsers from reporting health, phones from sending nearby WIFI device names to google,<br>and perhaps even lying to the vacuum cleaner that there are no updates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This kind of a firewall needs a normal CPU, a desktop CPU,<br>there maybe content rewriting, domain masquerading, video caching, and maybe even serving privacy conscious versions of intent websites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is possible to pre-fetch internet news and then serve it without the noise,<br>pre-fetching makes it so that Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit will only see the downloading all the news and not what the customer is doing with it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will make the news faster and snappier,<br>and makes it available when the internet goes down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can see that here Google will not compete against you,<br>you will control it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some years into it a company like Amazon will notice profit loss, and turn their creepy eyes at your company,<br>this may mean that devices will search for the firewall and refuse to work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In most cases, these devices will be returnable and under warranty, as your customers will own your firewall for a much longer period of time,<br>but you must also produce a heath or privacy report for a device - simply to prevent its purchase in the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Seeing how much traffic has been blocked, and even experiencing the occasional averted hack, or leak, or theft,<br>nobody!... will be interested in purchasing a device that bypasses their firewall, their safety net.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here where social media is usually used against the consumers, by manipulating them; even if just into some purchase,<br>it will serve as a way to advertise your product, which will also feature a free software based version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instant global audience, friction less adoption of the free software version,<br>and a perfectly reasonable offer of the easy to configure all in one firewall computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When apple started, all they were selling is computation, little later they were selling optional apps,<br>it doesn't matter what program you use to type up your text.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even today Apple sells a Phone, that while giving, also takes away,<br>your Firewall, is strictly a Positive Contribution to The Modern Household, it only gives, and never takes away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to the very approach you should take,<br>you are the CEO, and all you should be concerned with is CEO-ing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will approach investors stating that you will merge <span>The Interactive Little Snitch Firewall Experience<sup>[6]</sup></span> with the <span>Household Wide Pi-hole Approach To Traffic Filtering<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>if that is something that you are passionate about, you will no doubt receive a small research grant.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The Pi-hole approach to installation has really nailed everything about the installation down<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>I would only suggest allowing your users to download a Debian based distribution, with your firewall pre-installed, then your users can boot from a USB stick, or a LiveCD.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once ready to ship your Hardware, all you are doing is branding it,<br>and re-using the operating system that is already available as a free download.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your job as a CEO is not to know HOWTO customize Debain into your own Operating System brand,<br>your job is to find a company, or hire a team member, that will do it for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nor should you concern yourself with Hardware, or greatly customizing it,<br>you just need a company that will brand all-in-one computers for you, and put the operating system image on the hard drive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am certain there are companies out there that will allow you to choose the case color,<br>choose gold and purple, and few people will complain that ti is just a stock computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The computers that you will eventually ship are special,<br>as those are the computers you will always test your Operating System on first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they will change, when you are forced to pay too much for the 2030 model,<br>then you switch to another company and focus on supporting that computer with your OS.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As we talk about the Operating System,<br>you can see why being passionate about stopping the damn vacuum cleaner is critical.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take many years of research and development,<br>and no matter how much money there is to be made, you will become tired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing,<br>everyone who owns a phone is in desperate need of your product.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything on their network is always talking,<br>this is unsettling even with devices that have not yet been hacked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It may seem like your GPS coordinates and nearby WIFI networks are not a big deal to be send to google,<br><span>but your private information will eventually leak to the intent, maybe even on old hard drives that have not been properly destroyed<sup>[9]</sup></span> to save money that year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A lot of your information has already been beached<sup>[10]</sup></span>, the last ting you need is to continue adding to that,<br>as <span>that information will make it easier to associate your medical records, private emails, location history, DNS/browsing history, and even your earnings as the case was on Twitch<sup>[11]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember that your cheap vacuum cleaner has an open SSH port on a modern IPv6 network,<br>and <span>inside your unprotected robotic vacuum cleaner is a picture the entire layout of your house with 5 centimeter precision<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to take leaked information back, it will permanently stay on the internet,<br>the only thing that will work, is to stop leaking information, in the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a website where you can see if your email address or phone is associated with a breach,<br>visit <span>https://haveibeenpwned.com<sup>[13]</sup></span> (where the word owned has the hacker spelling of <span>pwned<sup>[14]</sup></span>), enter the email address of either alice or bob at gmail dot com, to get an idea what it means to get hacked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The world needs your firewall,<br>you can do this - but only if you are passionate about it.</div>
