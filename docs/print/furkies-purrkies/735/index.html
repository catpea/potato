      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Curse Of The Universe: Why We Must End Ineffective Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unless we actively press for the advancement of Human Kind,<br>we will discover that we are regressing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like a ball kicked up a hill,<br>we will eventually make make our way back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes three decades to catch on,<br>this is longer than most people care to pay attention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless we are deliberately advancing forward at an urgent pace,<br>the bad things that can happen, will eventually happen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Call it,<br>the Curse Of The Universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Call it,<br>Uneducated men think all the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Call it,<br>all pretenders can only hope to play a game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or call it,<br>the curse is such that nobody knows much.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And in fact those who advance tooth an nail,<br>often live in a warped world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will never discover,<br>all the miracles of being all too human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will instead function like pinball machines,<br>if this than that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their worlds have no color,<br>they are just endless chains of misconceptions and bad ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians in their lack of education,<br>misunderstood meaning of progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The scientists and philosophers,<br>took to thinking of our species, as "young".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I lack the class that is necessary to prevent myself,<br>from noting, that that word is a euphemism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But errors in our thinking continue all the way down,<br>the curse of lack of real education corrupts all our ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cheerful minds of great thinkers are sold,<br>long before it finally occurs to both sides that war is hell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And politicians, just can't understand,<br>that warlords and dictators only emerge out of stupid they sew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must understand,<br>what real education is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That it is a path that we each belong at,<br>and a path to Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is fuel for wisdom,<br>and factory of thoughts that help us reason by subtle analogies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to grasp that real education,<br>comes from storytellers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the very definition of real education,<br>emphasizes <strong>integration</strong> of all the unique answers and curiosities that each nobly holds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That children can only learn,<br>on paths of great interesting challenges and colorful adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That we each assume,<br>we have a good education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though few read books,<br>and most haven't even read one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though we know through and through,<br>memorization and cramming for tests wasn't an education...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we didn't learn anything in the process,<br>we pretend so hard that we force the your generation to repeat the same mistake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To add insult to injury,<br>beneath our misunderstanding of what schools are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians have taken to believing,<br>that we are workers, and our job is to support the economy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That in order for the world to get better,<br>we need to go back to the office and work a little harder...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We're all in this together after all,<br>they have a job, you have a job, do your job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And hopefully you are the kind of a person,<br>that remembers to pursue happiness as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I dare say they call it,<br>freedom of choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us pull ourselves out of this,<br>by nothing more, than our own shoelaces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The unique and productive futures,<br>that we can each reach when set free of poverty and small mindedness of our leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must begin by framing our unique greatness as an aim,<br>above all other aims.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whereas question of why we are here is a silly question,<br>the question of the rise to our greatness is all this world has.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To aim for greatness,<br>is to accept the responsibility for outstanding self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By means of books and adventure.<br>and especially fine disregard for rule.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means to build a path towards certain unity,<br>and away from hell-of-war and evil-of-hollow-leaders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means that the road to all those miserable things that can happen,<br>will fall to dust, as students rise above a malformed vision of the word...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And catch a glimpse of the future,<br>future where there simply is no poverty, where there are no borders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Future that M.A.D. and uneducated men can't see,<br>because they don't see value in human life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Human, freed from poverty,<br>is a Human that eventually returns infinitely more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The curse must be lifted,<br>what little we can do with out obscured visions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The little ones will multiply,<br>until their children will see the future in full.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not a wage slave, you are not a servant,<br>you are all the hope the future has right now, and you are meant to Become A Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Go to the library, the travel and adventure section,<br>where you will find adventurers who share their minds and experienced.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin with the first book (or narrated book) on the top left,<br>and never stop, never stop learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Follow in the footsteps of your favorite writers,<br>until you too can write, until you too can add to your favorite section.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The aim is not an even at the height of your greatness,<br>but that you lived your life as a great being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you added to underline the importance,<br>of Humanity progressing towards the culture of greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you were seen, that you were heard, that you helped the little ones hope to be like you,<br>in your creativity, knowledge, wisdom, class, dignity, and greatness.</div>
