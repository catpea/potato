<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The creation of an expensive series of paintings,<br>is a multi-step process.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It begins with creation of a theme,<br>for a series of four or nine paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then photo-manipulating and photo-bashing prototypes together,<br>or the creation of an advanced digital-photo-based sketch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then using this photo manipulated image,<br>as direct reference, the perfect source of correct color and shape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it ends with the creation of either a single copy of the paining,<br>or a limited number of copies, 500 hundred for example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This final step requires the creation of a custom frame,<br>that matches the theme of the series.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the canvas it self should take advantage,<br>of the painting being digital, and containing multiple layers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't just flatten everything,<br>use the options digital painting offers to create something new.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Printing on multiple panes of glass,<br>to create depth is one such idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However you print it,<br>print it out with microscopic precision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To make it even more,<br>fascinating to look at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It must be a smooth process,<br>from start to finish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is why you work everything out<br>in the initial photo-bashing session.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is important, because eventually,<br>you will be working with client’s faces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An high priced paintings,<br>means that there is no room for imperfections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the most important thing,<br>is that you never go to sleep frustrated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you always,<br>have a successful painting session.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why you should use that advanced reference technique,<br>and photo realistic sketch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Selling art, especially if you choose to work with deadlines,<br>has the power to take happiness away from art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world is being choked by poverty,<br>because politicians don't know how to upgrade the concept of money...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And turn it into something that helps humanity,<br>and not holds it back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This enormous error will trickle down,<br>into your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example when the money from the next series of nine paintings,<br>can pay for a home, or medical care, or something that makes life safer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Having that advanced reference sketch,<br>will always keep you moving forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the while constantly teaching you new things,<br>and training your artistic abilities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is also up to your imagination to tie the series of paintings together,<br>put them in a futuristic, prehistoric, comedy-horror, or a marshmallow universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look at books at the library, art books at the book store,<br>browse some movies, lookup cartoons - find a common theme.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose Pop Surrealism, know that despite all the chaos,<br>it all comes together in its title.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which you can find in lists of <span>Catchy School Slogans<sup>[1]</sup></span><br>or even <span>List of university and college mottos<sup>[2]</sup></span> which are often in Greek or fancy and barbaric Latin.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They won't sell at first,<br>but every gallery has an empty wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use something as powerful as multi-creature Pop Surrealism,<br>to shock the gallery into asking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why in the doodle...<br>is your art not on our wall?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, I once saw a person open two windows,<br>in one he divided his image into a grid, and in the other he started copying by hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was very painful to watch,<br>because he got tricked by crappy teachers and their lectures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And probably became scared by being shamed by his friends,<br>who also got tricked by fake art education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know this, digital painting,<br>is not an alternative to traditional painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an upgrade to painting,<br>and it is a superpower.</div>
