      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Century Of Freedom And Equality</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We fixed it all,<br>in our brilliance we made the necessary leaps forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But,<br>it was a slow and rough start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We forgot about our brothers and sisters in the poorer nations,<br>children in the streets, people without homes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty was creating addicts and criminals stressed out of their minds,<br>into making choices that they would not have made, had they had a fair start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity needed to pull it self together,<br>it needed an International Bank that only concerned it self with a daily spending limit of $100 US dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only did the poverty choke the wealthy nations pushing them into uneducation and lack of compassion,<br>but it caused unimaginable cruelty in the less fortunate nations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bank, as an international institution, begun serving all people, of all nations,<br>everyone understood the symbol on the card - everyone knew - the change was permanent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It all started at the turn of the century when Earth felt like a prison planet,<br>people tolerated corruption, poverty, human rights abuses, and they didn't know prisons were bad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People tolerated human suffering,<br>because they too suffered, most commonly poverty, fear.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the philosophers later described the state affairs by comparing Humanity to an addict,<br>we were addicted out of poverty, to working so hard that our minds rejected our own brilliance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity was in the process of destroying its body, Earth,<br>like an addict destroys theirs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At first no one imagined that lack of education is a spectrum disorder,<br>they would laugh, and see the very gateway to peace as yet another wall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Political corruption has remained the same for hundreds of years,<br>there was only one modern rule: Don’t Get Caught.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was not just about sticky fingers,<br>but also remaining under the radar and doing as little as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was another arm of corruption that was rarely talked about,<br>and that is the deliberate destruction of life by exploiting loopholes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The same as criminal hackers did to computers,<br>cunning politicians did in revenge against their enemies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Illegal imprisonment, prison beatings, character assassinations,<br>and raids by advanced tactical squads were not unheard of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The chilling effect of seeing your wife bound,<br>and little dogs shot, worked to crush spirits, all too well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But corruption evolved for a simpler world,<br>a world with plenty of space to hide, and plenty of time to clean up and retire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In large part due to corruption,<br>the space in which liars thrived was erased.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Malaria became the latest pandemic as it made it way even to Northern US,<br>the viruses from turn of the century continued mutating, and ecosystem collapse brought the world to a stand still.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just as soon as populated areas saw the disappearance of insects,<br>everyone realized that we needed instant change, or we would disappear too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There were no riots, no protests,<br>but not a single liar ran for office for all the stories that filled the news.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A new amendment is in the works, it requires that only well educated are allowed to run for the office,<br>it is worded by the people who saw the death of insects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The prison planet scenario as it has been called,<br>was only sustained by corruption.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The actual prison industry collapsed, along with several others,<br>as the “Don’t Get Caught · Do As Little As Possible” resigned from the office.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The silent invisible corruption was discovered to be such a blight,<br>as to be impossible to sustain with force past the end of the century.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Part of the Uneducation Spectrum Disorder barrier meant to keep corruption out of the office,<br>was a long runway in which a political hopeful had to convince people of high achievement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Admired Scientists and accomplished Philosophers were finally able to run,<br>the capitol gained hundreds of sculptures of renowned scientists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Privacy was declared a human right,<br>a law against obscured or encrypted code that meant to prevent consumers from fully examining their devices was passed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The criminal cyber underworld was decades ahead of everybody else,<br>it was the underground criminals that benefited from privacy violations the most.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most significant change,<br>was universal income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It took no effort,<br>and for ages the bank used a single computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Universal Income card grants each human being about 3.5 million dollars,<br>it does not track this number, it only makes sure that no one can withdraw $100 in a 24 period.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The economists predicted the end of the world,<br>the corrupt governments their own collapse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But nothing happened.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A person requests a card,<br>and it is sent to them no mater where they are int he world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At midnight in each timezone the account balance is set to $100 United States dollars,<br>It is the same for all accounts no matter how much was spent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty was a kind of slavery,<br>it hurt the minds of the people that suffered it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It prevented people from getting a real education,<br>it prevented them from becoming the best versions of themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty secretly corrupted the world creating a prison planet of wage slavery and corruption,<br>we will never know what might have been had we been able to end poverty decades before.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Afterword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a great being,<br>and a lover of thousands of the world most beloved books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To live without the wisdom committed to our books,<br>is to live the life of a slave.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A wage slave who cannot help,<br>but to become a slaver for the next generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cycle of poverty, abuse, captivity, and corruption must end,<br>do not wait for climate change to reveal the naked emperors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In their blindness and sickness of greed and un-education all they will ever be able to say is:<br>“How were we supposed to know?” and they can only ever speak those words in a bone chilling tone that will reveal that not only were they naked on the outside but hollow... on the inside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Encourage your friends and family to real education,<br>help them to the library, introduce them to books by helping them checkout the most beautifully narrated biographies that change lives.</div>
