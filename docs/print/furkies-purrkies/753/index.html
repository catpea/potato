      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Hyperrealism, A Teacher And A Protector</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything beyond Hyperrealism,<br>is a delicious problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your road,<br>is your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can dive directly into Photogrammetry,<br>and base your next portrait on a 3D model.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or You can open up your reference photo in GIMP,<br>and adjust the color temperature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or you can challenge yourself to a vision quest,<br>by desaturating your reference photo completely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mixing the color from scratch may feel relatively counterproductive,<br>but it may lead you to a series of simplified portraits, or color studies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where you for example just use three variations of a color dark, medium and light,<br>instead of a full palette, which will force you into more abstract creations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In short the lessons in your path,<br>come from your curiosity about the infinite world of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no teachers here,<br>you move at your own pace, and in the direction that calls to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hyperrealism means two things to me,<br>one that it is a teacher, but also that it pushes poverty away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here, my reluctance towards hand drawn portraits,<br>really comes to the surface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People looking to purchase a keepsake,<br>may not be interested in the artist’s own impression.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think maybe,<br>this is the root of the starving artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine that you wish to purchase a portrait.<br>of a dear family member.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Someone who always cared about you,<br>and helped you in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you want the artist’s hand between you,<br>and your loved one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or do you just want,<br>a perfect, beautiful portrait.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That captures,<br>how you see your loved one with your heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The problem of the artist’s hand has gotten so bad,<br>that nobody thinks about portraits anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I should clarify that...<br>I do not blame the artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the teachers that in their incompetence,<br>reinforced some terrible ideas about art, just to keep students busy in class.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forget the starving artist nonsense,<br>you are Royalty, you are a Hyperrealist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin with nine perfect portraits, and a small display of the reference photos,<br>and time-lapse (or just progress screenshots, or layers you use).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You deliver it to your potential client,<br>and they immediately understand what they will get from you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally I think realistic portraits should start at $1,000 dollars and sometimes carry on past $20,000,<br>this immediately tells your customer everything they need to know about folks selling portraits for $50 or a $100 bucks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While you are waiting for clients,<br>you work on expanding and improving your art portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You work on your coffee-table book,<br>and the art-book that tells your story.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you continue improving your online lectures,<br>covering more and more; as you learn more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should have a photography website,<br>and consider selling time-lapse videos of nature, as a camera is on $50.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take time to record eight or twelve hour scenes<br>of summer days turning to night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Capturing the symphony of insects, birds,<br>trees and weather.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The customers that recognize the quality of your work,<br>will have no problem waiting for you to finish existing work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you show them a list of the projects,<br>and your daily progress, on a video site, they will only love their portrait even more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I also I wanted to warn you about social media<br>do not base your company on something that flimsy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Keep stuff on your own website,<br>and be ready to remove the link to whatever is causing you distraction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hyperrealism is both a teacher,<br>and a way out of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or at the very least,<br>a way to push away fears, brought on by poverty, away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art is part of our heart,<br>it will teach and protect.</div>
