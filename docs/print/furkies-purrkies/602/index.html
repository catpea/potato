    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School or College is an amazing time to read,<br>and on our own we can learn anything, in deed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you can learn anything,<br>then you should aim to contain everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is one of our perks,<br>and how a universe works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the more you know,<br>the better your decisions go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until your mind is fully grown,<br>your decisions are not quite your own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must all grow up as fast as we can,<br>that is what it means to be human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who are misinformed about the world,<br>are being controlled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There as as many motives as there are crooks,<br>and cure is found in reading thousands of books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not all falsehoods look like lies,<br>they often have an elaborate, golden disguise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So do not read just one,<br>but countless books that are celebrated by everyone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best books are often said to change lives or the the word,<br>and those are the only true gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Go to the library and look,<br>that is all it takes to find your first life changing book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, we live in a beautiful age,<br>where you can <strong>listen</strong> to books without turning a page.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, do not delay,<br>search for your book today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reading of listening to books is about moving from what you were told,<br>out into the real world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The real world is not a scary place,<br>so as long as you hold wisdom in firm embrace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to find real friends,<br>is to look at life though your own lens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To learn and learn to no end,<br>until you become worthy of being and having a real friend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In reading books you will find that those who run to bars,<br>eventually regret it in their memoirs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The meaning of life is found in rising up,<br>in being serious about growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes people don't need a liar to become mislead,<br>and become crushed by sadness instead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is because they don't know that one of the library's treasures,<br>is to grant us the sacred ability to resist all crushing pressures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the most heartbreaking thing in the world<br>the oldest story hardly told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of finding a cheerful book,<br>they turn towards another heartless crook.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So much ache and regret is had,<br>without knowing that a silly book can cure being sad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books can cure us from all manner of woe,<br>and continue encouraging us to fully grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Merely belonging to some circle or group,<br>often just leads a person in a loop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But books help us rise from misery and strife,<br>and being cheerful is very important in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For one we begin to glow in a way,<br>it is probably the class with which we move though the day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we stop turning our trouble off to relax,<br>and begin laying down our own tracks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is almost funny that the old library,<br>is how life stops being scary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you take to books, and wisdom, you don't need to follow what we are told,<br>you will be safe out in the real world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the decisions we make are fueled by wisdom and are truly our own,<br>we will learn to live wisely and with wisdom become fully grown.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would be amazing, if following other people took us to the library,<br>but in the modern culture it takes us to the bar - where life will absolutely get scary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to set our foot down,<br>and say "I am not going through life with a freaking frown.".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hey, maybe you can be the one,<br>that will show her friends that the library is fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Could you become your school's first inspiration,<br>that leads everyone to the wisdom in some magnificent oration?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bring your friends to the library and quietly whisper to them the amazing parts,<br>show them the wisdom and all the beautiful hearts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that the move away from books,<br>will almost always take them towards creepers and crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that we find each other in life by means of light,<br>and that we are seen the best when we glow bright.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that it is in the wisdom we find and not in doing what we are told.<br>and that we have to search through many books to find the real gold.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The universe within us requires stars to create the constellations we need,<br>and you can only ignite a star, when you read.</div>
