    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can draw,<br>look at the things in my drawing, it is all super simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all Artists,<br>and it is very important FOR OUR HEALTH that we create art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are sure to create countless works,<br>there is an organization principle that will help you keep things tidy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Always sign and date your works,<br>even if it is just a crooked circle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Seemingly unfinished or broken things are very important for your art book,<br>they will show your beginnings, your progress and serve as icons or decorations in your book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But your Art Book comes second to your Portfolio,<br>and the portfolio is the organizational principle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take good care of everything you create and upload it to<br>a <span>popular online portfolio site<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Over the years,<br>you will create a fascinating catalog of all your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People will love to visit your beginnings,<br>and contrast them with your later works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As a side note if you ever try to sell your art,<br>the company doing hosting and payment processing may ask to see your portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are in High School,<br>your art portfolio will become much more important then the diploma.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No matter your age,<br>find a coffee shop that will exhibit your works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Print them out on shiny paper,<br>and make some sticker versions to give away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry if people scribble on your art,<br>they are really busy in their minds, and more than anything they need your help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Give the troublemakers plenty of stickers,<br>and encourage them to become artists too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">If you aren't sure what you want to create,<br>there is this amazing art movement called <span>Low Brow, or Pop Surrealism<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To me low brow is about cute strange things, that make people of all ages smile,<br>like the silly cat I drew for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect, that Low Brow is the greatest form of art,<br>ever created.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Flow, the biggest part of the reason why you may feel that you are stuck,<br>is that you are forcing the creation of something that can't be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't try to paint a portrait of your Aunt for her birthday,<br>not at first anyways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Paint the birthday,<br>if only the local cats showed up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Start with the eyeballs of the first cat,<br>make one bigger than the other... give the cat an adult beverage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And flow to the next cat,<br>your aunt will love that more than her portrait.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She will recognize that you were overflowing with silliness and creativity,<br>that the artwork you create for her, will only exist one time in this universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The program you should use is called <span>Krita<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>and you need the <span>$40 XP-PEN 640<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In digital painting,<br>you are tasked with managing layers of your painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means that eyes live on a different layer,<br>than the tones of a face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can spend an afternoon painting eyes,<br>and it will not warp or influence any of the other layers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of my favorites is the Q-Tip that does blurring and blending,<br>in a way, it almost acts like a gentle eraser, kind of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It gives you the might of tweaking details,<br>there are a few tools that let you move the paint around, but the Q-Tip is the coolest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way you find in-between colors for blending,<br>is just by using the eye-dropper on whatever you already have on your screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The right mouse button will give you the popup menu,<br>and it is quite enough to adjust colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if you need more control,<br>change to Wide Gamut Selector under Configure Krita &gt; Popup Palette.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The first thing you will face is the choice of brush,<br>and I know exactly what it is: The Air Brush!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It seems like it is meant to spray large areas,<br>but no! that is the main drawing tool, it is for me anyways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to make it spray small, or course,<br>but your edges will always be neat and soft.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used the flow brush at first,<br>but it makes visible layers that need blending, use a small Air Brush.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember to make sure that all your layers are locked,<br>except for the one you are working with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This cuts down on confusion,<br>on busy days.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Paying extra attention to your layers,<br>means you will never mix them up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Always name your layers well,<br>be it Krita or Blender good organization keeps confusion away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you are done painting the outline of the thing,<br>lock the transparency.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, go the extra step to just create the outline of a cats head,<br>if you lock the transparency your brushes will only work on the existing paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a wonderful way of masking everything away,<br>now you can spray around the edges without ever going outside them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Tab will put your user interface into full screen,<br>so that you can focus on art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bring whatever it is that you are working on into the center of your monitor.<br>this way you will always work in the center of your tablet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Zoom is how you draw perfect lines,<br>if you are working on an eye, zoom all the way in and make your brush bigger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you have difficulty drawing hair right to left,<br>hit the M button, this will mirror your drawing allowing you to flick hair left to right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My final words of advice to you is to get really, reallllllly mad,<br>you've been born an artist, and nobody told you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rage, rage,<br>and RRRRRRRage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Paint everyone that has ever stood in your way,<br>with shiny googly eyes, in strange places, and above all strange positions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Turn them into animals,<br>that they really are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you ever paint yourself kicking their butts,<br>I hope you paint yourself with a shiny crown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because you are Royalty,<br>you are... An Artist.</div>
