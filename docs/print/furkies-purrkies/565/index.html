      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Great Challenges</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot exist a Manual Of Life,<br>because each and everyone of us represents a unique story that can’t be summarized.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We each make unique decisions,<br>based on our previous experiences.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some years ago, I was called to Jury Duty,<br>and wanting to learn more about it I've read <span>Michelle Alexander's<sup>[1]</sup></span> book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I once wanted to be a Judge,<br>but that book changed my opinion about our Criminal Justice System.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will use my struggle to comprehend what has happened,<br>in this text, to demonstrate how Great Beings like Michelle Alexander change the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How challenges transform us, and transform within us,<br>how they enter stories like this poem, so that they are never forgotten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as we grow in wisdom,<br>we will add to the gravity of the situation so that the changes that the world needs will come sooner.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Overall, we can say that you are supposed to bring on an age,<br>in which students can trust teachers with real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This age will result in a massive increase in the global education level,<br>the kids will take care of the rest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are just as important as the world,<br>you deserve an early retirement, cheerful days, and a happy life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am asking you to think in terms of multiple generations,<br>no one person should be made to suffer the mistakes of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You contributions need “legs” as <span>Loyd Blankenship<sup>[2]</sup></span> calls it,<br>it is probably an audio book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you like,<br>you can give speeches like <span>Richard Dawkins<sup>[3]</sup></span> or <span>Brene Brown<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To write that book,<br>you need to get at truths in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to arrange them in a coherent network,<br>that will help others understand the world a bit better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you learn you will become passionate about certain things that move you,<br>Ecology, Mass Incarceration, Human Rights, Real Education, Real Growing-up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The things that you are most passionate about,<br>with enhance the things that you have learned from other Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you comprehend Indoctrination,<br>you will see that criminals are not really themselves when committing crimes in their youth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are still deadly, but they are not to be punished, they need a real education,<br>as despite the evil things that people do sometimes they are not by choice, but a mix of indoctrination and drugs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Indoctrination,<br>need not have a designer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people who first started using an early notion of money, for example,<br>never intended to put the world in poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty emerged on its own,<br>nobody designed it, it is just that people are not yet wise enough, to fix it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Neighborhood violence is another emergent indoctrination,<br>it is aided by poverty, and the sick idea that nobody can disrespect a person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This idea will drive people to prison,<br>and it will persist in prison, making officials think that prisoners are a lost cause.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A person researching these matters is bound to realize that these kids and young people,<br>are raised misinformed about the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why crappy police officers say that “criminals are stupid”,<br>what is actually going on, is that they are living in an alternate reality fueled by broken things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here we can see,<br>that the people we sent to prison were not even themselves when committing their crimes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A human being that is enabled by real knowledge and resulting wisdom,<br>and allowed to grow up without being <span>choked by poverty<sup>[5]</sup></span> or <span>devastated by depression<sup>[6]</sup></span>, will become perfectly beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people we call criminals, victims of indoctrination,<br>the stuff clouding their judgment just emerged out of poverty, lack of education, desperation, fear, hunger, loneliness, harm and hurt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Prisons are places that punish and harm even more<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>this is not what people who were not acting of their own volition need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those kinds of people need to be unindoctrinated,<br>they need to be brought into our world, into our reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you were to write such a book speaking about criminals as victims of indoctrination,<br>it would up in the hands of inmates, prison officials, guards, politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And small changes would begin to happen,<br>as more and more people would see that we’ve been sending our children to prison due to our own blindness, and lack of foresight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Such a book would not just influence prisons,<br>but add to the gravity of all other good changes that are queued-up in the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On this case you would have two types of changes,<br>helping inmates out of their alien world, and and preventing people from ending up in prisons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dealing with existing inmates,<br>which would require converting prisons to schools in the hope of undoing their indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And prevention, which attacks the indoctrination it self,<br>this adds gravity to universal basic income programs, and to <span>real education programs such as Will Richardson hints on<sup>[8]</sup></span> and changes that <span>Michelle Alexander<sup>[9]</sup></span>, <span>Kandice Sumner<sup>[10]</sup></span> and <span>Duncan Campbell<sup>[11]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Break away from all that you know, and reject fake education,<br>and begin learning for real from hundreds or even thousands of the wisest books-and-narrated-books you can find at your library.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Search for entire lifetimes of knowledge and wisdom,<br>look for adventures, biographies, storytellers, philosophers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And become a Independent Great Being,<br>because the thing that <strong>you</strong> need to do, lies just past the tipping point between your Wisdom and your Greatness.</div>
