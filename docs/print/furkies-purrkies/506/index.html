    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">History and Politics,<br>are not as boring as they may seem at first if you have a good reason to look at them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not everything will make sense,<br>and almost all people will be wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just think back to some historical mistake,<br>and look around, the same thing is happening now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People think they know, people are certain they know,<br>people blindly believe that we will become right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thinking back to moments of historical crisis,<br>and examining the minds of the majority, is a good tool for thinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look at the Philosophers, Poets,<br>Artists, Orators and Leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People look to history for a lot of reasons,<br>and understanding the Mind of Humanity is one of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Understanding the present by subtle analogy to the near past,<br>and perhaps making future projections is a good way to get a good picture of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">History is tough and often sad,<br>but truth is more important than comfort.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially,<br>when future of Humanity Depends on it.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Along with study of history,<br>comes the study of politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has that lovely quote,<br>“True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Kurt was correct to be concerned, and the way to do him justice, is to fix education,<br>so that Kurt, would be happy to see the wise friends he grew up with running the country.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ineffective education has real consequences,<br>because the students who pretend to learn today, will become the leaders of tomorrow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>In the absence of teachers<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>we must become the teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We accomplish this by working towards the most coherent picture of the world,<br>that we can get at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will never feel perfect,<br>in great part because the world is not perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Governments are just countless people moving in slightly different directions,<br>the thing that makes a difference is them having been enabled with real education and resulting knowledge and wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of knowledge and wisdom, along with lack of greatness and restraint,<br>is why world history is stained with tragedies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of sadness in the past,<br>this is our time now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A chance to learn and create a picture of the world,<br>and <span>help others to the beautiful wise beings we discovered during our own journeys<sup>[2]</sup></span>, so that they too may grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here we have an opportunity to contribute to the prevention of future mistakes,<br>by simply <span>rejecting ineffective education<sup>[3]</sup></span> and learning in great part from great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more we know the faster we learn,<br>and the faster we learn the shorter the road to wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a great journey, and to earn a balanced view of the world,<br>probably requires decades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Knowing where we stand in relation to our world,<br>is an important part of learning about Humanity, and ourselves, and the endless future ahead.</div>
