      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Growing Up On Planet Meow</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My growing up was strange and abstract,<br>hardly anything on TV made real sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And my comics were complicated and nuanced,<br>and I never had all the issues, just questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the TV shows where I come from aim to be strange,<br>because I still don't know what <span>Przybysze z Matplanety<sup>[1]</sup></span> are all about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember little more than the intro of <span>Sonda<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>which was a pretty reasonable science show, but I never knew when it was on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I grew up watching <span>5-10-15<sup>[3]</sup></span> as in years old,<br>and to this day I remember wondering what the hell it was going to be like to be 15.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I thankfully skipped over that period of my life,<br>by coming to Unites States, the magical city of Brooklyn, NY.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was aware of English words, but I would mostly understand things from context,<br>it did not help that I learned most of my English from the <span>DJ Kat Show<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If it wasn't for Inspector Gadget and Ninja Turtles,<br>I don't know what I would have learned, DJ Kat was as wonderful as random.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There were some odd Eastern European shows too,<br>such as the cigarette smoking <span>Wolf and Rabbit<sup>[5]</sup></span> from Russia - Ну, погоди.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think my favorite thing to do was read the comics,<br><span>Thorgal<sup>[6]</sup></span> was about a Viking from outer space.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Funky Koval<sup>[7]</sup></span>, a futuristic secret agent,<br>saving the world from aliens and something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And <span>Rork<sup>[8]</sup></span>, where I only had one book,<br>and it seemed to have been about science and monsters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had a few copes of <span>Hans Kloss<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>which was about a polish spy in germany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I was younger I basically learned to read from,<br><span>Kajko and Kokosz<sup>[10]</sup></span> and <span>Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek<sup>[11]</sup></span></div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It was my earliest education for sure,<br>countless dreams were had about all the unusual things in there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I settled down in New York,<br>and became a fan of X-Files.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I took to the New York library,<br>to look up stories aboutt the Sasquach and <span>Mokele-mbembe<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To me my trip to the library was absolutely the same as learning from comics and shows,<br>it wasn't so much about entertainment but trying to understand the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I read many paperback about X-File like stories,<br>and simply realized that is how religions are formed, there was no fact there, it was all fantasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The last paper-only book I've read was "<span>Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner<sup>[13]</sup></span>",<br>shortly thereafter I ran from canton to Ann Arbor, I think it took me six or eight hours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was more shuffling, than running,<br>but again, it was an amazing educational experience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then, as I bough a proper MP3 player,<br>I stumbled upon Bill Bryson's <span>A Short History of Nearly Everything<sup>[14]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It quickly became my favorite Audiobook,<br>I've bee re-listening it the last couple of weeks before sleep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That book connected me to all the other books,<br>mostly Science, and Adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">I didn't really use any books to learn my programming languages,<br>early on I would type in a concept followed by the word "tutorial" or "HOWTO".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As in "Visual Basic Database Tutorial", now I just browse the documentation,<br>I actually try not to memorize things on purpose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I still memorize, but without trying,<br>I like looking things up, I like finding new things to learn when I search for something else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">It seems like there is about ten or twenty things that I am learning,<br>things Circuit Design, Music Composition, 3D Modeling and the like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I break things down, in music I am currently focused on Drums for example,<br><span>lmms is testing a new audio sample set<sup>[15]</sup></span> (instrument sounds) and there is a much nicer drum selection now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In circuit designed I got very comfortable with simulating circuits,<br>because then all the math is done for me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My biggest realization was that all those breadboard prototypes with all the wires sticking out,<br>are fed into computers to automatically create the circuits we see on circuit boards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">SO the breadboards,<br>are the bees knees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In 3D modeling I am still training myself to think in terms of 3D printing,<br>there are huge problems with not being able to reliably print overhangs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there are strategies such as cutting the 3D shape in two,<br>in such a way as to eliminate overhangs, and later snap the two parts together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no real limits in modeling for 3D printing,<br>but I like creating problematic 3D models that help me grow my knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just recently published,<br>the <span>world's most daring Dryer Machine knob<sup>[16]</sup></span> and it feels great to the touch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have to enlarge the socket in back,<br>but it is already tapered, so it will become one size fits many.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way I learn is by pausing one thing and pushing another,<br>and when I feel I maxed something out, I switch to something else, and later return with wiser solutions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have never gotten stuck,<br>never overwhelmed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning,<br>has always been very fun and relaxing.</div>
