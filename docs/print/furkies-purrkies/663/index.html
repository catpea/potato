  <div class="paragraph">My classy ski mask and lightweight bag arrived today,<br>and though it wasn't too cold I took them out for a test run.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was dark by the time I got ready,<br>but I had a wonderful time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My dancing helped me become a tiny bit more flexible,<br>and this helps me jog by rolling the ball of my foot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While I am a perfect slowpoke,<br>it felt really good to use that jogging technique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I tried using it before it felt awkward,<br>like there was no reason to go through the extra steps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now I can really feel the difference,<br>between ruining on the front part of my foot and gently rolling the back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It made me look like I was just walking in a hurry,<br>but it felt wonderful.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Though I prefer the city,<br>I ran towards the I-275 trail for a change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a bit of stretch there without city lamps,<br>and it felt magical to run in the dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though there were plenty of cars,<br>getting away from the city lights is kind of relaxing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I hopped on the trail by the highway to take in the dark a bit more,<br>and before I knew it my eyes were used to the night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is rare that a night is just dark,<br>I could see all the trees just fine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I turned off my dim headlamp,<br>and there was no trouble seeing the path.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Just a few steps from a busy road,<br>and on to a trail by a highway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you can already feel nature,<br>and all the noise aside it felt fresh and healthy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I shuffled few extra feet and turned around,<br>to head back to the city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My fancy winter hat kept me warm and cozy,<br>and an extra layer of flimsy long sleeves made the temperature just right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I probably need a break from jogging for a couple of days,<br>but I could have ran a slow and relaxing 10K easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is dancing that strengthened me,<br>made me more flexible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jogging, helps to earn the endurance for dancing,<br>and dancing grants strengthens and flexibility.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a perfect kind of easy training,<br>and both feel great.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I use light dumbbells for both,<br>and this helps with arm and shoulder strength.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dancing more than jogging helps to develop abdominal muscles,<br>there are all kind of little benefits coming from both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jogging calls for nature,<br>but dancing is done best on a stable surface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Combined and bicycling, and hiking,<br>it all becomes more like a happy little adventure than a healthy workout.</div>
