  <div class="paragraph">A sketch is a question about your source image,<br>how will it look like, how is the light, how does it scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But sketching is also a great way,<br>to create many fancy drawings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art, this day an age,<br>begins with a cute original photo that you took.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally I believe,<br>that cuteness or silliness is a must.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art is not just about the image,<br>it is about the best kinds of feelings.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Get an <span>Drawing Board<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and protect it from moisture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Drawing boards are made very light,<br>they may have honeycomb structure on the inside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And get out of your house,<br>never draw alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you have nowhere to go,<br>go to a coffee shop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Avoid sketching paper<br>and just splurge on the thicker 12x18 <span>Drawing Paper<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Attach the paper to your Drawing Board with painter's tape,<br>or low tack <span>drafting dots<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lay down a sheet of Graphite Paper,<br>that you can easy erase with an eraser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then apply your source image,<br>just print it out on four sheets of 8x11 and attache them together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used to visit an office print shop,<br>and I printed out my images on large paper, but that is not needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have a printer,<br><span>get a cheap laser printer for a $100<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is really important that you use painters tape to attach your print out,<br>so that you never have to worry about it moving as you trace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The graphite paper you have left, maybe smaller than your drawing paper,<br>so you may need to move that one around as you trace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need a <span>Graphite Pencil Kit<sup>[5]</sup></span> with an eraser,<br>and blending stumps, which are rolls of paper that help you smear out or blend graphite.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not make a difference if it is expensive or not,<br>pencils are pencils, and you shouldn't pay too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The thing about art pencils is that they are of different shade or softness,<br>the #2 pencil we usually use in school is just an HB pencil, one of a dozen variations or so.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not a good idea to draw with an #2 pencil,<br>because that is just one shade and you can't make it darker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art pencils have lighter and darker colors,<br>the ones that start with H (H2, H3, H5) are harder and lighter, and the B ones (B2, B3, B4) are bolder and darker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I sometimes use a <span>graphite stick<sup>[6]</sup></span> to fill in a lot of area,<br>but that only works well on really flat art boards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Graphite sticks are like drawing charcoal,<br>but a bit smaller, it is just a square stick of graphite.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it is useful to get an <span>eraser shield<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>especially if you want to reflect the sun in eyes that you darkened already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eraser shields work best with <span>battery powered eraser<sup>[8]</sup></span>s,<br>which are kind of useful, especially when adding light to a near compete sketch or drawing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am ashamed to say, it took me a while to figure out what eraser shields were for,<br>somehow, the thin shiny metal with curious little holes, was very mystifying to me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you want to look extra nerdy, get a <span>Drafting Brush<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>to brush off eraser fluff from your drawings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I never had the courage to use one my self,<br>but the more I think about it, the more sense they make.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then just start tracing with a pencil, outlining large dark areas,<br>marking the reference points you may need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't want to draw on your print out,<br>use a <span>Ball Stylus<sup>[10]</sup></span> normally used for working with clay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even after I am done tracing,<br>I sometimes leave the original still attached to my drawing board.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not just because I may need to add something,<br>but because I like flipping back and forth between my drawing and the original to see if the shade is correct.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I call it the shading flip technique,<br>and it helps you keep the tones just right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just tuck the original behind your drawing board,<br>until you are almost done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then add the pencils, and blend with the blending stumps,<br>the <span>big blending stumps<sup>[11]</sup></span> are the best in my opinion, #6 or even #8.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then mediate,<br>enjoy the relaxations of art, and occasional smiles of strangers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If someone likes your drawing, and you are almost done,<br>consider giving it to them, just sign it, and let it go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are going to do that, bring big envelopes along,<br>I used to reuse the ones I had my original print-outs delivered in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way the stranger won't have to worry about making them dirty,<br>as they walk them back to the car from the coffee shop.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can make a business out of it too,<br>have people send you photos of their relatives or pets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just help them understand that a good photo,<br>is one that looks great in black and white.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Strong light and bright areas;<br>and deep dark shadows often make for best source images.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you ever get stuck,<br>gently copy the shadows and light from a similar photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Using this tracing and shading flip technique,<br>you won't have a problem with proportions and tones at all.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There are very few nicer ways to spend a winter,<br>then making silly drawings at a coffee shop.</div>
