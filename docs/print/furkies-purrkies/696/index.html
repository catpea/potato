      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Glance At Future Of Programming: A Neat But Incomplete Introduction To Coding</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is still not for everyone,<br>the tools are still to primitive, and all to incomplete.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But progress is being made,<br>and things are changing for better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is this very interesting program called Node-RED,<br>it it hard to appreciate it for what it truly is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before I get into details, let me say that node-RED,<br>is the first in a very powerful class of applications.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world needs 10 or 20 such programs,<br>Node-RED is not perfect, but it is worth the while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On its website it is described as,<br>"Low-code programming for event-driven applications",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is also a program that mixes graphics and code editors,<br>without needing gigabytes of RAM.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a visual programming language,<br>that helps you both, diagram, and type code into friendly little boxes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What Node-RED, really is,<br>is a code editor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is a beautiful start to learning programming,<br>because it represents how all serious programming should work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The main layout of the program you are working on,<br>must be a graph that captures the Theory Of Operation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The meat of a program,<br>needs to be completely hidden away in well defines spots.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact, in is best, that somebody else creates those inner modules,<br>you should focus on just the layout, and definition of what you need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Event Driven Applications,<br>are similar to broadcast towers and radios.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tower sends out a message,<br>and things listening to it react to that message.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the safest approach to programming,<br>as programs are always evolving.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Emit Messages and Listen For Specific Ones,<br>is a pretty flexible surface for future expansion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a visual programming language,<br>puts those towers and listeners on an even surface for all to see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Event Emitters and Listeners had one problem,<br>they were hard to keep track of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Node-RED colorfully,<br>takes care of that problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">JavaScript is the language of the future,<br>and Node-RED, is the code editor of the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>If you spend a little bit of time with the tiny tutorials<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>not only will you learn about programming, but also programming the right way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Node-RED is still hard to install, and there is no save button, only JSON export,<br>though <span>there is a Desktop variant<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But once you have node.js on your system,<br>it is a matter of running <code>npm i node-red</code> and then just run <code>node-red</code> on the command line to start the local server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the best starting point for all this is <span>node.js tutorials<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>once you see how npm works, you will be able to get to node-RED, and try out the <span>cook book ideas<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Node-RED teachers programming the right way,<br>and that means what you learn here will improve your npm modules, and portfolio, and all that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right now, the most important thing to take away from Node-RED,<br>is that there is an emerging space for high level editors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an invitation to learn programming,<br>and build your own visual programming language and a business empire to match.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I imagine a module that helps a person new to programming,<br>set a monetary bounty for a module they need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just a handful of video tutorials,<br>could create a new market and open the world of efficient programming to all.</div>
