      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Letter To All Human Beings</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We face many problems,<br>that unfortunately can't be fixed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't bring back tigers after they are gone,<br>we can't do anything after a Nuclear War.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't remove corruption from politics,<br>because it permeates it, because it is politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While these problems have no solutions,<br>there is something gentle, wise and wonderful that can be done.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The irreparable can be prevented from occurring,<br>the events leading up to disasters <strong>can be</strong> collapsed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are two powerful measures that people of the world must institute,<br>Real Schools, and A Poverty Ending Bank.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The bank does not make a person rich,<br>the money is only meant for food and savings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">$100 dollars per day in 2020 money,<br>constantly adjusted for inflation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are ways to ensure one card per person,<br>but card fraud does not matter, only that we take care of the poor matters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You send in a piece of paper, even if you can't write, a squiggle will do,<br>you get a card with your mark back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Card is reset to $100 at Midnight Greenwich Mean Time,<br>everyone gets to eat, and set money aside for rent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All humans beings will be approved,<br>no exceptions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bank is a simple computer program,<br>it does not track debt past 24 hours, it just resets the cards to $100 dollars at Midnight GMT.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just an international institution,<br>it is not part of any country in particular.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Critics, please understand,<br>and understand for what you stand for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I leave it up to Philosophers to plow the depths of this crime,<br>and bring light to the misery we all spread by accepting Poverty as part of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools have never worked,<br>any and all the success that was had came from well educated parents, tutors, well to do families, generational wealth, and luck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The year is 2022,<br>and we still don't have schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a handful of educational institutions that function under the disuse of serving the gifted,<br>they may in fact function, but the idea is to charge more for special kind of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that way,<br>all our educational institutions engage in fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Much like the international bank,<br>an international school, independent of any nation is needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will produce a program much like MediaWiki that powers WikiPedia,<br>but it will function as a game where users must solve puzzled to open doors to the next room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first room is called the Lobby,<br>and here students choose a door that interests them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The subjects are nothing like what we see in standardized education,<br>they are far more encompassing and include a little bit of everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will provide a short list at the end of the letter,<br>but to give an example, Adventurer, Humanitarian, Hacker, Security Analyst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are not subjects, they encompass partial snippets of what we teach in school today,<br>and as the student progresses through they gain a full picture of science, mathematics, art, music, but in a context that is relevant to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This school encourages the use of tutors, almost always student tutors,<br>it does not have teachers, the school is the teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It uses very simple technologies,<br>so that program can run on inexpensive low powered hardware.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be many instances of these servers,<br>and they will constantly update to newer versions as those come in reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some nations choose to obscure historical facts,<br>this is not a long term solution, their attempts at tampering with their copy of data are to be made known, but ignored.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first students will be those equipped with computers and cell phones,<br>and one of the most prestigious challenges they face, is to keep translations up-to-date, and provide nations devastated by poverty with solar power and audio versions of the school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no graduation, the students are rewarded for life long learning<br>and long term contributions in the form of new resources, paths and rooms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With student permission on case by case basis, potential employers can request to see the path or mesh the student has traveled,<br>and thus find students with the exact skills required.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The World is being held hostage by Poverty and Lack of Education,<br>it is hard to see at first, because we tend to accept the world we are born into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We tend to listen to our guardians that accepted the world they were born into,<br>in that way we are are all Blind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Schools and the Bank,<br>change the way things are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the new Students will become Stronger and Wiser than us,<br>we will all be gone by the time they take to reshaping their future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But our contributions will be permanent,<br>the first large deliberate stepping stone aimed at the advancement of human kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The School and the Bank will erase all the confusing problems of today,<br>an educated world that does not punish it self with poverty is a simpler world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You and I have grew up and lived in cities that were programmed into Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles armed with Nuclear Warheads,<br>we've beet taught to warship the imaginary, to honor the corrupt and the cheaters, and to label things with ugly words and throw them away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We labeled and threw away people into mental institutions and prisons,<br>without ever trying to prevent poverty from fracturing their minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are taught to label life giving things as Communism or Socialism, or Conspiracy,<br>and to quickly throw them away, as if to prevent our corrupt politicians for feeling shame for us, that we would do such a thing as to hang on to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are not in the right place,<br>we have been mislead for far too long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But all it takes to see that school is not working,<br>is looking back at our experiences in high school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And all it takes to see that we are wage slaves,<br>is to imagine a life with a $100 per day card.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know it is a bit scary, but just consider what you have given up of your self,<br>for this stupid idea that we are all meant to be poor, that this is how things are meant to be, for reasons too complex for our simple minds to grasp.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help your children understand that their poverty is neither your or their fault,<br>that it is a mistake that humanity has made while growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With each grade remind them that schools are the worst form of education,<br>and that they are little more than training for a life in which one is drained of mental health, strength, and bodily health, just to be replaced by a new hire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like companies will lower pay and increase workload, like store will increase prices and lower quality,<br>schools will decrease knowledge and encourage memorization because on paper knowledge and temporary memorization looks the same, and thus everyone gets paid just the same.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help your children understand,<br>that Poverty is an Error, and Schools never worked past the first few years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that even so,<br>they are still charged with becoming Great Beings, and that must never change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
