  <div class="paragraph">I hope it is not bad news, when I say,<br>sculpture is more powerful than diamonds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Diamonds are everywhere,<br>but a uniquely sculpted pendant or ring is rare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is good news for 3D printed jewelry,<br>as it can be shipped directly to the customer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It just needs a bit of polish,<br>there are no stones to set, no intricate parts to detail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who are printing or casting your ring,<br>will take care of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Purely geometric 3D jewelry is very interesting,<br>but it is abstract.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I highly encourage creating a scared geometry,<br>line of rings, even if just for practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just as highly I encourage,<br>to create a line of rings, pendants, bracelets, and earrings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where the stones aren’t so much set,<br>but slid int to the bands or construction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just to be cleverly secured,<br>possibly with a clever removable gate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But creating a frog ring, with three or four frogs,<br>or maybe one big one, is so much more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is mysterious, meaningful (if that is the little critter that your customer chooses),<br>private, personal and extremely unique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every piece of jewelry has a message,<br>and all things considered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">White diamonds have a message too,<br>along with a dark history, and artificially set price.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe just me, but a collection of well worn beach glass,<br>that was collected by the customer, on beaches around the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cut to size, maybe polished, and encapsulated in a pendant or ring,<br>has a more colorful story to tell, even though it begun, as discarded glass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But a ring, or an entire collection, of all kinds of things,<br>that share the same sculptures, that is just unbeatable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially since, that same sculpture,<br>can be brought to the big world, as a five inch figurine of a collection thre of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You could even design a series of spoons, coin pendants,<br>even invitation cards and logos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if it is not too much to suggest,<br>you could use the same 3D models you sculpted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a painting, where you would first map out the scene and lighting in Blender,<br>and then take to Krita where you could use that scene as a Reference Image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if that wasn't too much to ask,<br>then <span>learn a sculpting style from out ancient ancestors<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And paint a series of paintings displaying them in full dignity and glory,<br>presenting the multiple paintings in a silent graphic novel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just name your collection after the culture that connected with you,<br>become a modern caretaker of the style, of their most decorative works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t have to set the price to be astronomically high,<br>and some collections can be sold a few hundred times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But not countless time,<br>out of respect for your customers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I would like say, that geometry and wire frame,<br>rails into which you slide precious rocks rather than using heat or solder...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Diamonds, all manner of interesting rocks, famous pieces of glass, and precious bits, micro meteorites, glowing tritium capsules, and fancy crystals...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All make for beautiful jewelry, but we shouldn't forget history,<br>especially ancient times, as that is where Jewelry had its birth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I suggest, that every once in a while, for every modern piece you create,<br>you recreate an ancient one too.</div>
