    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I've only tasted knowledge,<br>and I've not heard of a real College.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've been to plenty of schools,<br>and better than most I know their tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bullies, Grades, Punishment, Shame, Threat,<br>and above all, Debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While you remained seated,<br>you have been and lied to, and robbed, and cheated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I may,<br>I know what they say...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lesson number one,<br>you are not a Genius little one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lie number two,<br>I will be fairly grading you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And insult number three,<br>I am holier than thee.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It as all a lie,<br>it was a lie they knew your were going to buy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have you the moment you measure your own soul,<br>with grades... they have you whole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you've been a Genius all along,<br>that's why school is wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hawking and Einstein were no smarter than you,<br>they just learned more the more they knew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Hawking reversed time in his experiment<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>and Einstein was riding a train to his merriment<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So please tell me where is this Genius that you are not,<br>...Oh yes, you are a lot smarter than you thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think as long as schools are a dog and pony show,<br>we should think of them as foe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And their tests cause harm to books too,<br>as they split them in two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe that what you learn of a book in school,<br>come graduation, you will forget as a rule.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is the norm,<br>that we are unable to read until our first camping storm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember a thunder so vile that the ancient dune shook,<br>and I remember reacting out for my book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Robinson Crusoe,<br>by Daniel Defoe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A copy I found at the Ludington antique store,<br>that I hang on to thorough the storm's roar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've listened to hundreds of books before, and hundreds after,<br>but until then I could not imagine Robinson Crusoe's laughter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you read a book in school, or for school,<br>they are truing it against you as another tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you can't have the experience needed to understand,<br>they are forcing you to pretend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what a dog an pony show is like,<br><span>they just cannot help but to think you are all alike<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, "Can you connect with a book without adventure?"<br>as far as I am willing to venture... Probably not.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will only truly understand to what your most powerful book alludes,<br>if the book is the only other universe in the woods.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few hundred books after that, without fanfare or surprise,<br>you just ... become wise.</div>
