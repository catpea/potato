      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Philosophers And Warriors</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To invent we have to stop being scared of poverty,<br>we can only invent in peace - and that requires courage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fear really is the mind killer,<br>but it is also true that we are all warriors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are many things we can do in life to become courageous,<br>we can listen to great books, take to great adventure, become observers of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Or set up a cabin by a pond, ensure biscuit and tea,<br>and write to become the Great American Philosopher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes a lawn makes for a great pond,<br>and thus our lonesome apartments too, can serve as a proper cabin by the Walden Pond.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Courage must come first,<br>this is very sad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, overall,<br>courage is good for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Aside from helping with invention, it is great for little adventures, petting large animals,<br>or getting into mediocre books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is worse, is that people like teachers will unknowingly destroy<br>genius, creativity, invention, and force students into memorizing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whether they know it or not,<br>we can’t let anybody rob us of our genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School is just a drop, in the ocean of life,<br>but it can trick us into thinking that we aren’t smart, if we let it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are supposed to invent,<br>and become independent from the rest of the world.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I remember in my Plymouth High School,<br>there was a drawing made with markers, and it seemed so perfect, that it made me feel stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I thought to myself “I could never create something like this, college is not for me”,<br>the marker lines didn’t overlap, the colors were amazing, and the portrait was beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lacked wisdom and courage of invention,<br>I lacked courage to say “I will invent my way to this”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Back then I still didn’t get around to contemplating talent,<br>so I thought it was something people were born with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is stupid to think that someone is born with the ability to kick ass at markers,<br>we are risen apes - not fallen angels.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I never lacked courage for standing up what was right,<br>because I could see and feel that bullies were evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I dropped out of the high school the moment the Biology Teacher said “weed is an herb”,<br>I don't need to hear more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here was the first time I faced a true enemy that truly outranked me,<br>the Guidance Counselor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He told me I would never be anything in life,<br>who says such things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think this started an investigation,<br>because when I showed up at the AdultEd, they were waiting for me.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There was a coffee shop near by,<br>the teenagers there were out of control.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But to me they were just crazy,<br>they were not evil, they would do no harm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember sitting on the couch,<br>and looking up - someone took the ceiling panes home and used them as canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a panel with electronics on it,<br>and what clearly looked like water colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the kids that were there,<br>that painted them - the troublemakers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A 29 year old woman showed up one time, I called her Wendy,<br>I immediately warned the main troublemaker to be kind to her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She looked at me and said “Oh, so this is the bad boy” pointing at him,<br>he told her that we would only cause trouble because his mom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On second thought,<br>the teenagers at The Brew Ha Ha, were Angels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our world ended when the Brew closed,<br>we all immediately grew up to become Philosophers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everywhere I went,<br>was crawling with Philosophers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had to make a stop to get good at programming,<br>this was before my first job - which required it - my parents complained.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to be courageous,<br>and when we see no other way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be it teachers, parents, schools, bullies,<br>we must retain our integrity, and protect our genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bad people and those who are mislead into doing wrong things, always lose - always,<br>they become crappy stories of growing up and what not to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being courageous and protecting our genius, clears the mind,<br>it helps us unplug from the errors in other people’s heads.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must courageously push all the unimportant and frightening, and even ordinary things,<br>back!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are each a powerful genius,<br>all we need is a couple of hundred narrated books at the library to get started.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once our wisdom ignites,<br>there is no telling what height we will reach.</div>
