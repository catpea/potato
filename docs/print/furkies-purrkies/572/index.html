      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrading The High School Diploma To A Real Design Portfolio And Beyond</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is not good enough,<br>and after graduation we still need to get a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those happy students on graduation day,<br>how can the schools do this?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You probably suspect that your parents are using High School as a babysitter,<br>and your teachers are giving you a fake education to get paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You surely already guessed that you are being pushed into college,<br>where you will be robbed of all your, and your parents savings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, your employer will be aware that your High School didn’t matter,<br>and that the College Diploma requires little more than cramming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First of all you are in danger of having your education stolen,<br>and being mislead in life, which may eventually lead to mental health problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasies, empty promises, and fake education, eventually do add up,<br>but they create stress, confusion, feelings of something being wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very difficult to catch on, because you don’t know the future,<br>and you can’t contrast what you have with what you need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies, narrated books, are your primary source of real information,<br>and then you need to begin self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stay in school, but do not let it interfere with real education,<br>keep an eye on the people that are fracturing already, tell them it is all make-believe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ones that go first are often very brilliant,<br>and can make for great authors, artists or leaders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their problem is that they think they are stupid,<br>someone needs to tell them everyone is just memorizing, and that the school is fake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Too many people are benefiting from fake education,<br><span>you will not stop them, no one can stop them<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to go around them, and give yourself a real education,<br>by learning from thousands of biographies written by wise people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use narrated books to accelerate your learning,<br>and never make real education second to the fake one - not even for a semester.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">I know that design is not for everyone,<br>and not everybody likes computers - I certainly don’t.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But at the very least, do take the time to see the full picture,<br>as I hope to present it here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are self educating by creating products in the physical world,<br>products that can be sold as 3D models where <span>the customer may request that some company prints them out<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>This means that you start with a pencil doodle and end with a physical product<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>one that you can pass along with your design portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As far as securing a job goes,<br>this is the right way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Documenting your design process,<br>allowing people to print your more expensive products is how you get a real job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is a problem, they will want you to have a High School and College Diploma,<br>they want you to have what has been called a “Balanced Education”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These folks forgot the tests they crammed for were useless,<br>and they have no idea that 400,000 Americans die each year from medical errors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even if they did have the idea,<br>they wound's associate it with fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As they ended up paying for it, studying for it,<br>and celebrating the graduations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why I call it a problem,<br>you have to choose real education or fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you get a real education by self educating yourself,<br>you probably want to find a real job among those who are self taught.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I however,<br>I recommend going one step beyond that</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I recommend you run your own company<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and never look back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The road to a successful company,<br>is painted with happy little failures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failure is the most magnificent teacher,<br>to fail is the greatest pleasure in the business world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you learn more and more,<br>it eventually becomes impossible to fail, but you always keep the lessons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fail hard, fail fast,<br>rise with each failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all else fails,<br>build a re-combinator, a local startup accelerator that you co-found with people as brilliant as you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here all the young enterpreneus in the area will be reporting ideas to key figures in the field,<br>helping each other grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To get there,<br>start with design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Build a beautiful design portfolio,<br>and begin dreaming from beginning to the end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take the <span>Blender Doughnut Tutorial<sup>[5]</sup></span><br>and familiarize yourself with <span>Boolean Operations<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Grab the Ender 3 version 2 3D printer<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>and consider installing The <span>CR-Touch Auto Bed Leveling Kit<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will be your on-ramp,<br>start modeling jewelry, wallets, belts and belt accessories.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These things may sound simple to you in the beginning,<br>but everything here is an explosion of creativity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you sit down to something as ridiculous as designing a belt,<br>next to the 3D printer that you just put together, in front of blender.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">3 weeks into it you will master the printing,<br>and create the most uncomfortable bat belt that people will buy for Halloween.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But here is the trick, you will continue designing all the bat belt modules,<br>as a way to master Design, and make your portfolio shine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, it will occur to you,<br>that you can build an escape kit, for safety purposes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Members of the press traveling to a dangerous country,<br>may wish to pack your escape kit featuring lock-picks, handcuff key and variants, ceramic blades, and so on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see how something as ridiculous as a belt,<br>easily transforms into a small niche company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lets take jeweler for example, lion rings that don’t look fake on the inside,<br>that aren’t empty - already creates a unique product line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Follow through to create a consistent jewelry line that looks beautiful on the inside,<br>as well as outside,<br>and allow orders to be made in any kind of metal from inexpensive aluminum to heavy gold - and you have a new company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why not give away resin versions,<br>for free - that’s in expensive advertising.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every idea, and every burst of creativity, or explosion of possibilities,<br>creates more ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your design portfolio,<br>is just a start, before you know it you will be building tiny companies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And your real education will take you to heights,<br>that fake education does not allow for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In conclusion, tell me who <strong>you</strong> are more likely to hire,<br>the college taught with a diploma, or the self taught with an endless portfolio?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People are stealing your educations,<br>and are making you celebrate fake graduations!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get mad,<br>start hard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let the 3D printer,<br>and remind you what it is like to actually learn for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you do venture into the world of business,<br>rather than getting a diploma and a job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Embrace failure,<br>plan for it, savor it, and enjoy it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because business failure,<br>is both a precious teacher of great wisdom, and a rare gem that will eventually be denied to you.</div>
