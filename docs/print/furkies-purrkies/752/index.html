    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are three important points in today's fast paced world of art,<br>question the teachers, embrace using reference images over full canvas, and make use of 3D models.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One, on the subject of teachers, I will say that Art does not need computers,<br>and a good artist can still perfectly capture a person's appearance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is cruel to throw logs at the student's feet,<br>especially those who are new to art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are being purposefully and artificially delayed,<br>with concepts like hand-eye-coordination, and the promise of art is never fulfilled at graduation anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all artists, and we should all start with realistic portraits,<br>from there everyone will find a different calling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Two, we must ask what is better, a fanciful painting of an imaginary face,<br>or the perfect painting of a real person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real person will smile,<br>and truly appreciate the work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And imaginary faces,<br>are trivial to generate on a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By extension,<br>can we paint a face free hand, with a line model, or even with a grid...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Given that a high resolution digital painting hay hold 10 to 20 intricate details,<br>in the nose a alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A keepsake holds a snapshot of a person,<br>but without any of the burdens of a photo, and with all benefits of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means, the eyes, the eyebrows, the lips, the nose,<br>must be exactly right, as that is the foundation of the portrait.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything else can be a dream,<br>but the face must be true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because in 50 years the person in the portrait will look back at their younger self,<br>and they they will recognize their youthful nose, and all features of the face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will contemplate their history,<br>and daydream through all their adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A photo can't capture a person's face,<br>but it has all the information an artist needs to create the artwork worthy of the person in the painting 50 years from now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now,<br>three.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The future of art, is already here<sup>[1]</sup></span>, it is called <span>Photogrammetry<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>beyond taking the photo of the subject, you should also consider a scan of their pose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Offer them a range of locations,<br>that you can generate a preview for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Technology will only improve,<br>but only a human will be able to artistically present the person in the photo or a virtual scan as the case will soon be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world of art is evolving,<br>but no machine will ever replace a poet.</div>
