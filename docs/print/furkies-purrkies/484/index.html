  <div class="paragraph">We are not machines, we are meant to flow,<br>we are not meant to pick careers for show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are not workers, we are thinkers and creators,<br>we are not meant to spend our lives as system administrators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot just follow rules,<br>we are not mere tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to fix rules, and think of the future of the world,<br>we have to leave behind all the broken politics of old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we are not echoes, we must accept nothing for granted,<br>because the old rules somehow always end up being slanted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To be force fed disconnected facts, fat fact after a fat fact,<br>means you are being attacked.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can't triumph by pretending-to-learn-and-graduating-top-of-class,<br>that only means the teacher is an ass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Find you books, treasure them and reread them to no end,<br>there is nothing to be gained when teachers trick us to pretend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to add little sticks to little sticks,<br>before we light the fire of fixing politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our true strength is not just in numbers but in wisdom as well,<br>we must each get a real education before we ring that bell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are nature, like a river we must flow,<br>and we each need sunshine, winds, and rain, and snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lessons cannot be taught, a mind must be free,<br>lessons must extend like leaves on a tree.</div>
