    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long ago, I have discovered that revealing the fraud of modern education,<br>and having crazy amounts of fun while learning it for real, is one and the same!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before I babble any further,<br>I wanted to share a program I just made for all of you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can find it at <span>https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/<sup>[1]</sup></span><br>under the name math-101</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And on github at:<br><span>https://github.com/catpea/p5<sup>[2]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is almost exactly the same kind of program I wrote,<br>when I stopped learning in school because of bullies, and being accused of copying when I was writing my own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What you will discover in this program is coordinates of 0,0,<br>in the lower left hand corner - as it should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a tree with four generations of branches,<br>red, green, blue, magenta.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The code is plainly spelled out, not in a loop, not in a <span>function<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>just friendly computer math that solves it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then at the end, when branches get too small,<br>I do make a loop, to show you what a loop looks like - and to finish off the top of the tree.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This tree is very special,<br>because it represents plain math, the math we use every day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But to fix the branches of the tree,<br>to make them more artistic and realistic like in <span>Bret Victor’s Inventing on Principle<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>We can’t just use plain numbers, we need to upgrade them<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>to something more capacious.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The numbers we use every day are called Scalar,<br>the upgraded numbers are called Vectors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Vectors store value called magnitude plus an angle,<br>and this is what we need for our tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to say this branch is 20 pixels,<br>but at a 15, or 30, or 45 degree angle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't do this with Scalar numbers,<br>because when you have things at an angle they can’t be calculated with subtraction and addition, the tree branches wouldn't be the same length.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we need to leg go of x and y,<br>and focus on line length which will be the same for all the branches at a particular level, and angle which will differ for all the branches.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look at a real tree,<br>branches in the middle are almost of the same length, and branches at the ends are very short.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Any source of information on the subject of vectors will give you all the formulas<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>they are all very easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, there is a bit more to it,<br>because angles, mean circle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That’s where all the PI comes from,<br>and the consistent lengths of a set of branches, is just the circle radius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We choose angles,<br>because that’s how branches grow on a tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And angles are best handled by means of circles,<br>and what is really cool, is that a radius of a circle makes for a fantastic representation of the length of a branch on a particular height.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To angle our virtual branch,<br>we draw a line at an angle starting in the middle of the circle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this point,<br>we arrive at another area of mathematics, trigonometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Trigonometry is just relationships of lines moving around a circle<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>this is never explained correctly, and never given any real context.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is what our tree represents,<br>a need for Vectors, Vector Operations, and the underlying Trigonometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know that trigonometry makes people sad,<br>it represents failed tests, sometimes tears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But trigonometry is just relationships between,<br>lines, triangles, and circles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be sad,<br>get mad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Because trigonometry, is less than 50 lines of code<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>it is just that it has been mishandled by schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only big thing about trigonometry,<br>is that people studied it, and shared formulas, and knowledge about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a result we can just use their more general formulas,<br>rather than inventing our own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our own would just be a smaller version that only deals with representing branches for our tree.<br>Inventing the formula would use a triangle, just like trigonometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I hope the tree will call to you,<br>I hope the fact that I just used scalar subtraction and addition instead of cool vectors will call to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t know what this memorization nonsense that schools are doing is,<br>but it is not math, if anything they are destroying math, they are not teaching it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What I just showed you is the math,<br>it is interesting, and colorful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it can make us dream about generating infinite forests of unique trees,<br>and why stop at trees we can add birds to the trees, and generative squires, and little chipmunks in various poses,<br>an odd bunny here and there, and two deer with universally unique antler configurations, and why not a cat or too... they always seem to be everywhere...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...put a lion in there...</div>
