      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Pipe Programming: A Look At Object Passing And Transformation</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A pipe is a connection between two programs,<br>and through that pipe, we send an object that is altered to serve some final purpose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine you checking email,<br>you create a pipe between your computer and the email server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you send a request object,<br>with your password and user name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The email server,<br>will respond with an object that contains emails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we have programs connected by pipes,<br>through which we send objects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you are writing a program,<br>you are creating a pipework that connects programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then when your user uses your program,<br>as they interact with buttons, they send objects down the pipes you created.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While you can make a beautiful little program,<br>that takes good care of user-names and passwords, including their validation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to do it,<br>there is a crude and perfectly functional way to do it with just the basic operations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When a user clicks login,<br>and initializes an object down the login to email pipe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than doing something special for user name and password,<br>simply inject a new property to the object that the user initialized.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first time you inject user-name,<br>second time you inject password.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a generic injection program,<br>where you specify the name of new properties.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you follow up with a pop-up box,<br>that knows to ask for all the properties traveling down the pipe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing here is related to passwords,<br>it is just properties and a standard form.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When working with pipes in a graphic environment,<br>such as Node-RED.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can group the generic operations together,<br>and save them as a program called a sub flow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The name of this sub-flow would be ask for password,<br>It is perfectly reusable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Any object sent through it,<br>will receive an injection of username and password fields, or variables.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a automated popup,<br>will force the user to to fill in those two bits of information.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Pipes, Programs, Objects,<br>those three crazy simple things is all it takes to make programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This simplicity also reinforces,<br>efficiency.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In more advanced programs like video editors that use pipes,<br>Blender is a good example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pipes enforce the idea that a video is never sent whole,<br>but only one frame at a time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The video can be 100 terabytes,<br>but Blender will only take the memory needed for one frame, not the whole video.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what the word streaming means,<br>you are streaming a frame at a time down a connection pipe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than the user downloading the whole video,<br>this can be for efficiency reasons, or for the fact that the rest of the video does not yet exist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The black window command line that you see hackers use on TV,<br>is so powerful because it uses pipes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It uses the actual pipe character to separate programs,<br>and objects tend to be lines in a file.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, to guess a weak password,<br>a hacker would have a common passwords dictionary file.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it would be just one password per line,<br>they would then pipe the passwords to a login program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each line in a file is treated as an object,<br>the program reading the file would send objects one at a time to the program logging in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a successful login,<br>the login program would break the pipe and exit with a happy message.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And none of the other passwords would continue being streamed,<br>as the pipe is broken, and everything exits, including the program sending the passwords.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There are many ways that the concept of Program, Pipe, and Object are represented,<br>there are as many variations of this idea as there are programs that make use of it.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Old school programmers, don't like pipes,<br>they prefer to load an entire movie into memory, process it and be done with it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a terrible idea,<br>operations on a video file in RAM are much, much faster then sending frames at a time through pipes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others hate the idea of just three things,<br>Program, Pipe, and Object.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are used to creating entire Virtual Systems,<br>with hundred of objects, including a Password Object, User name Object, a Login Object, that contains both...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even a remote server object,<br>that is a virtual representation of the mail server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just having Program, Pipe, and Object,<br>is terrifying to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Having just three things,<br>allows for those standard operations like Inject, or Branch depending on whether the login failed or succeed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">ffmpeg uses pipes in the single most terrifying way,<br>they construct trees of pipes, or meshes really.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is all in a single line of text,<br>and ffmpeg allows for multiple video inputs, whhooh!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But once you know that it is just three things,<br>you are able to imagine everything in your mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ffmpeg makes it so that all inut files are numbered from zero up,<br>and it names results of transformations, giving you a named connection point to which you can hook in a pipe to another operation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you say ZERO, which means the first file that was mentioned on the command line,<br>then black and white, as in transform video to a black and white movie, and then...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then, you name the output of this transformation,<br>BW for example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, you say BW (just like you said zero a moment ago),<br>followed by add movie grain, (just like we said black and white), and then another name GBW.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now you use the GBW output point,<br>and connect it so some other transformation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here we think in threes,<br>INPUT_NAME, TRANSFORMATION, OUTPUT_NAME.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are focusing on connecting transformed data to to other transforming programs,<br>our named output is connected to a filer as input.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And sometimes names are optional in sequential operations.<br>it makes them easy to read, so that you don't have to keep naming the outputs and referencing them in inputs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be a fun project to create a Node-RED like user interface,<br>for ffmpeg, while you have exactly that in Blender, this program would crown ffmpeg with neat graphics.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is possible to reduce the entire Node-RED programs,<br>to hard to read command line, it would totally work - that is the power of keeping things simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Keeping down to a very primitive but capable system,<br>helps prevent leaky abstractions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think all abstractions are leaky,<br>it is just the nature of abstractions.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">What you have glanced here today,<br>also translates to Phone Apps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A screenful or a card would represent a program,<br>swipes left and right would show you the incoming and outgoing connections.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A pinch out or zoom out would show the entire network of Pipes and Programs,<br>and if you create a Hub for Program-Card programmers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where people can set bounties on cards they need,<br>you have a marketplace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By having this ability to request custom cards,<br>all your users become programmers.</div>
