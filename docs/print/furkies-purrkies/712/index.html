      <img style="display: inline;" src="/image/md-poetry-0712-illustration.jpg" alt="Caricatures!" title="Caricatures!">
      
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Caricatures!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow male and female faces<br>each have their own caricature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ladies have bigger eyes, smaller, (though not shorter) noses, and small lips,<br>and they are squished together towards the bottom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Germs on the other hand have their eyes bigger, noses shortened,<br>and lips can even stay the same size.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is cuteness for ladies,<br>and humor for gentlemen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I invite everyone to think of this as a starting point,<br>by the time you reach your tenth caricature, you will have a much better theory than mine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As with all things there is an exception,<br>and it is wonderfully ridiculous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will find this tool in GIMP, Krita's older sister (also free and open source),<br>and the tool is called warp transform.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pay close attention to the tool options,<br>as the topmost dropdown lets you choose: Move Pixels, Grow Area, Shrink Area, Swirls, Erase, and Smooth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you can liquefy a photo, smoothly enlarge eyes,<br>shrink the lips, warp without destruction photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The image once distorted, is little more than a low effort meme,<br>but when you take the distorted image to Krita...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Trace and paint and decorate it,<br>you are in business... pun intended.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think just offering realistic portraits,<br>cuts you of from a lot of giggles and potential customers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if foolishness is beneath you,<br>you may still need to practice it just to support your business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will make you laugh,<br>and that is always worth it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here I wanted to explain why my source image, is not perfect,<br>especially to those who are just joining in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just photo reference, a quick sketch,<br>to see if the final product will look silly enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not need to be perfect,<br>because to make a beautiful caricature, we must make a digital painting out of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just to paint the shapes of the eyes and nose,<br>it also serves as color reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The correct color chose,<br>is as important as the shape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wrong colors will absolutely destroy a painting,<br>portraits are special because you always have photo reference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Close enough,<br>is not good enough for color.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Portraits and caricatures, are a fine start,<br>one more thing that is needed here are backgrounds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I recommend abstract backgrounds,<br>making your portraits look like they are bursting out of a paint explosion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lastly, a word on sales,<br>you should be able to sell portraits for $50 dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They may take about five hours at first,<br>but that will eventually become one or two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It hurts to say it,<br><span>but the platforms that will sell your art will take a huge cut<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though some platforms will give the customer an option to have your digital paintings framed,<br>the process of framing occurs after the sale is made.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no warehouse to store your framed paintings,<br>it costs you nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sales platforms will demand exclusive access to your painting,<br>that means you can't sell the same painting on two services, but you can sell different ones.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to running your own platform,<br>yes, that is why you shouldn't stop at Art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not as awful as it sounds,<br>because you can build a program where people upload their photos and watch you work on the paintings of people ahead of them - until it is their turn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond that, you may with to build an application that will let others join your website,<br>and sell their works, where you can take a small percent of their sales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cut that the popular platforms take is too big,<br>so if you just take 5% percent then you can get a lot of sign-ups.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The main problem with hosting your own software are hackers,<br>so you will need to monitor for snooping, and use an off-site credit card processor with its own security, like <span>Stripe<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The programming you do on your own is only ever for prototyping and learning,<br>once things get series, you will need investors, and programmers that will do all the programming for you.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It all begins,<br>with some silly art.</div>
