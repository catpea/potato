  <div class="paragraph">Preface</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We can't have elderly suffering from poverty,<br>or people living in broken down houses, or poverty pushing people into addiction and or crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can make this imaginary concept of colored pieces of paper work for us,<br>we can grow up this century, or five centuries from now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think we can all agree that it is better not to wait with such terrible things,<br>we owe it to the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is better that they are born to a world where nobody is stuck,<br>where people have homes and food.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And something tells me, we are not going to be able to address climate change,<br>if most of us are scared of losing our homes and becoming hungry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just creating these side social security programs is not enough,<br>there needs to be a central program, by which the government and its people as a whole, are judged.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a thing that prevents people from ever being scared of going hungry,<br>and gives them a car and a home, and health care, dental, therapy, and a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These are good things,<br>that will make the nations of the world strong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't have a solution, what you are reading is an imaginary, philosophical idea, and a fantasy,<br>but it is meant to help you think about helping the entire world, not just one nation, all the nations, until we no longer have need for silly borders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every generation should end higher than the previous,<br>we the people of this generation, have to rise, so that the little ones don't have to put up with the nonsense that we had to live through.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are creators,<br>Humans shape Humanity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I am correct and poverty does hold humanity back,<br>then we need to get rid of it, so that we can grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Overwork will only force the little ones into more overwork,<br>we have to find a way to end world poverty once and for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Heart Card</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think, poverty is a kind of a civilization based virus,<br>it is propagated by small mindedness, and it emerges out of the primitive beginnings of each civilization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ultimately, poverty will destroy the civilization,<br>even if all it does is prevent the brilliant minds from blooming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't take my word for it,<br>all you need to believe is that poverty causes harm to the human brain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that it destroys our teeth, our bodies, our energy,<br>it twists our families, and it hurts our lonesome relatives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is enough, it means it is a global crisis,<br>a silent and deadly Health Pandemic that has been going on for thousands of years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it gets worse,<br>because in poverty a human mind is unlikely to grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means such a mind may grasp the dangers of climate change and pollution,<br>but the individual will do nothing to fix it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How can a person that works themselves to death to feed their family,<br>think about saving the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see what the problem is?<br>we are each a genius, but poverty hurts our minds, both on Neurological and Psychological levels.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The amount of money needed to fix this,<br>is infinite, there is no figure, it is always just more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus it should be illegal to track this money,<br>because those figures do not represent debt, they represent the advancement of the Human Kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Noting should stand in our way,<br>of Nuclear Disarmament, Climate Repair, and World Peace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the way we make this happen,<br>is by creating a special bank at the center of each of the nations of Earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This bank gives a person a plastic "credit" card,<br>that just works, that never runs out of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't withdraw a million dollars in a single day,<br>but you can withdraw exactly what you need to live unafraid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It buys food, but also books and audio books, and every decade or so will clear a car purchase,<br>it pays for hospitals, though it will haggle like hell with them, and it pays for all the things that a person needs to become a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This card cannot be denied in any way, or used in some way to hurt a person or punish them,<br>it cannot be taken away from people who are in prisons, if they wish steak, cake, music or the finest books, this will not be denied to them at all, nor will it be limited in any way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This card will buy a homeless man a house,<br>or a hotel room, in a different hotel every day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will also buy a person in danger of becoming a criminal,<br>whatever it is that they need to feel whole again, and prevent them from commuting the crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine what would happen tomorrow,<br>if we all got this card today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People, would buy food, cars, homes, books,<br>they could go in for cancer treatment without wondering if they will lose their home, or if they are going to be allowed in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would stimulate economy, intellectuals that we all really are,<br>and it would stimulate other nations to follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Since nobody is tracking how much people are spending,<br>there is no debt, there is peace, happiness, a huge drop in crime and soon to be empty prisons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This would help us focus on climate and world peace,<br>climate change and pandemics, could push the world into nuclear war, the politicians always have somewhere to hide, but cities and the world will never recover.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what evil people think,<br>there is no money to be made from poverty, and mind you this is a self imposed poverty, we all accepted that colored pieces of paper is a thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is good for keeping track of corporate profits, and Wall St.,<br>but it is not good to keep a Humanity in poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we don't have to give it to ourselves,<br>let us live in the mess that we created.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just need to give it to all the children<br>born after January 2022, let them have a Peaceful Future, because they are the ones that will have to fix the mess that we brought forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The card would be given to a child along with their birth certificate,<br>and it is no harder to replace than an ID card.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has a red heart on the front,<br>and a small explanation in the back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to learn Knowledge, grow in Wisdom, and grow all the way up to become a Great Being,<br>be good to your brothers and sisters. And please, look after the future generations, yet to come.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are born free of sin and delusion, but we do make mistakes,<br>because we come form of Apes and not Fallen Angels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we are also capable of fixing our mistakes and mending the wounds,<br>and rising above the less knowledgeable younger versions of ourselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The World was once plague by poverty, and this card is proof that we can fix our greatest mistakes,<br>in return we only ask that you may become a Scientist, or a Philosopher, or an Artist, or an Adventurer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We ask that you become a Great Being,<br>and make positive, meaningful, and long lasting contributions to the Human Kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are one family, the national borders are as imaginary as the blight of poverty once was,<br>as imaginary as the fantasies behind all the religions that divide the world in yet another way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are our Dream, and our Hope, help us, help the world unite,<br>Help The Human Family Converge on Wisdom and World Peace.</div>
