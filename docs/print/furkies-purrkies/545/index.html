    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most people mistakenly believe that Michigan,<br>is surrounded by what is know by Great Lakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In reality, there is nothing lake about them,<br>those are great sweet water seas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their real names are as follows,<br>The Michigan Sea, The Superior Sea, The Huron Sea, and The Erie Sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I have personally never seen it,<br>some parts of the seas freeze in winter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Originally the full name for Michigan,<br>was Cape Michigan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Cape is defined as,<br>“a large headland extending into a body of water, usually the sea”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is also a peninsula,<br>called the Upper Peninsula - often shortened to U.P. by the locals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the Cape is bound to United States,<br>By means of a land named Oh Hi, Yo!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is only technically, a state,<br>but it is really a welcoming point for the people arriving from the seas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the Oh Hi, Yo! Landmass,<br>is where my adventure begun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Frequently, I would find myself thinking I am going one way,<br>but realizing, I was going elsewhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I thrive on such wonderful events,<br>with one exception.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each time I arrive at Bowling Green, Oh Hi, Yo!<br>I realize that I have moved away from the seas, which is where all the fun if.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bowling Green is only as fun,<br>as it sounds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I cheerfully turned my car around,<br>knowing that now I am headed the right way on 275.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And grabbed some chips,<br>while I was at it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Munching on my chips,<br>I figured I should drive as far as the roads take me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As Cape Michigan,<br>can only take you to more sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up In the U.P,<br>by crossing a large bridge</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I discovered a shipwreck museum,<br>and decided to search for a hotel, in Paradise City.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hotel I found was magnificent,<br>they had a model of a great ship in the lobby, and I doodled it into my journal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oddly there wants anywhere to go,<br>but there was a tiny little store, and it was fun to look around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I spent most of the day enjoying looking at the Superior Sea,<br>it truly was a superior experience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though as I rent down for dinner,<br>I left the windows open.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And upon my return my room was filled with thousands of large mosquitoes,<br>so I grabbed a pillow and slept in the tub.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The shipwreck museum was a dream,<br>but I spent most of the time wondering how it was possible that there were 500 shipwrecks there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You’d think they’d learn,<br>after one or two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was there a goodie long while,<br>but <span>I made the mistake of not becoming more interested in bird watching<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is an entire community of bird watchers up there,<br>clearly this is something worth the while.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It was on my meandering way towards the more southern seas,<br>that I discovered the City of Ludington.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I stayed a whole month,<br>I explored the State Park, camped at the Jack Pine Hike-in sites, and got my first taste of Nordhouse Dunes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nordhouse is a small wideness,<br>positioned on the coast of the Michigan Sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had many great little adventures there,<br>swam in the lake during the day, and and build little bonfires to roast sausages for dinner.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never had a problem with mosquitoes,<br>and wilderness was free to camp in, the optional parking just a few dollars per week.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My second visit to Nordhouse featured a Magnificent Storm,<br>it was the most terrifying and majestic night of my life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was awoken in the middle of the night,<br>it was great thunder and a proper downpour.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thunder was all around,<br>and I was surrounded by metal stakes in the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was nowhere to go an nowhere to run,<br>just the bright flashes of the midnight sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I’ve put on a song I liked and the thunder grew tame<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and before I knew it the morning came.</div>
