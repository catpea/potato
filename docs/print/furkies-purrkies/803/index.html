  <div class="paragraph">All the complicated things,<br>are easy when broken all the way down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Digital painting is easy,<br>as you stop trying to finish the painting...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And instead,<br>focus on the steps in the process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each step can be done well or badly,<br>doing something badly does not guarantee predictable results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But doing the steps well,<br>will sometimes even surprise you with the result.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example,<br>pick your reference photo... well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you pick a blurry reference photo,<br>you may have trouble shaping the eye.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as a result,<br>the final painting will be off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In which case,<br>you hare to begin reforming the process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Peer pressure where someone is scared,<br>of other artists saying “This is not art, your technique is fraud.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Absolutely needs to be handled well,<br>because such an evil thing can destroy an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In this instance, you need to understand,<br>that this person is a destroyer of art and artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy others,<br>to make themselves feel special.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The technique that you choose is sacred,<br>it is to be celebrated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow and flourish as an artist,<br>so will your techniques go through countless transformations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art and Computer Programming,<br>are good friends because programming is step oriented.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one dares to sit down to finish their program,<br>before going through the different steps to be able to do it well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that way, Computer Programming,<br>teaches that there are well defined steps that must be taken in art as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you are looking for them, it takes no time at all,<br>to figure out where the seams in the process of another artist are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Watch a few artists paint,<br>or talk about their painting process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you will synthesize your own,<br>set of steps.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Is it always steps?<br>Yes - no child has ever been born predisposed to be great at graffiti, digital art, or church music.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you can see, how creating such a myth,<br>would help to sell their works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But after a while an artist or programmer,<br>will round everything off into a nearly seamless whole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is always steps,<br>and an expert always aims for a proper measure of excellence at each step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And after just a little while, it always becomes a unique process,<br>because as each artist grows, they refine and emphasize different steps, and take to unique directions.</div>
