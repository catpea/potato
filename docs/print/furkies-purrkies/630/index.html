  <div class="paragraph">Three quarters to go before the new century arrives,<br>and looks for advice in previous century's archives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That bright new generation can't connect with Socrates,<br>time makes it so that they won't be able to understand him with ease.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An examined life, and curiosity goes only so far in a century of change,<br>with loss of species, and climate becoming strange...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even Nietzsche's love for Music and his Infinite Strength,<br>doesn't quite travel the necessary length.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In truth, each generation relies on the previous for wisdom,<br>everything needs to be rebuilt the entire philosophical system.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Primarily because evolution of wisdom is constant and ongoing.<br>but also because Humanity is just growing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every generation has to look back to the previous,<br>take the best ideas and leave behind the inauthentic and devious.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And each generation must also verify that nothing good has been lost,<br><strong>all</strong> the good ideas must keep moving forward and at all cost.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Who are the leaders of the first quarter of this century,<br>who are the worthy who have forever earned a place in history.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And above all will you be joining their ranks,<br>will the next century remember you in appreciation and great thanks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, more then the galleries of today,<br>it is the book lovers or museum visors that will need your works everyday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need you to help them build up an image of who they are,<br>and that will call for your works and your memoir.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will need explanation for all the mistakes that we have repeated,<br>even if just to emphasize why wisdom is so much needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As early as possible they need to build up the mental capacity to see,<br>to see lies, indoctrination, manipulation, and where they <strong>need</strong> to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have to know what fake education is and why,<br>so that they can remove the blight and erase the lie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they need to understand that money was misunderstood and held the world back,<br>that's the real reason why we destabilized the climate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just that man made problems have man made solutions,<br>but that tools created by humanity and her institutions...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...must only be used for good,<br>so that she can wisely and safely reach her adulthood.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Neither poverty, hunger, hate, prison cages, wars or borders are to stand in our way,<br>and we must all look towards that bright new day...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When all the cultures on Planet Earth converge on wisdom,<br>the day when we will begin the creation of a wiser global system.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Future Humanity won't have a choice in the matter,<br>it will be either unite and thrive or fight and scatter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is where misusing tools invented by humanity to grow,<br>and never questioning the status quo, will twist us to go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is why you are being asked to become a Noble and Dignified Great Being,<br>so that you can prevent the worst of it with your gift of seeing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A gift rooted in a relentless pursuit of wisdom and foresight,<br>powers that in your Authenticity, will grant you great might.</div>
