    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please,<br>stop memorizing - that is not how we learn for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your continued participation in fake education,<br>only makes things worse for the Little Ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least,<br>you are to clear the way for their growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stop jumping through their hoops,<br>may your generation be known as the generation with the bad grades.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Poverty whether you conceive it to be hunger,<br>or decades of servitude in return for the smallest possible paycheck that will keep you working.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is just the boogie man,<br>it takes three hops to begin making money on your own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn about something you like, practice and find inspiration in similar creations,<br>and search for an outlet where such things can be sold, and setup multiple such little undertakings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Businesses slow down at random,<br>if you have multiple ones you'll be safe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One year you'll make $20,000, another $200,000,<br>if you leave it alone it just goes up and down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you continue learning,<br>the odds of not making money go down.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This life long career nonsense that we have been spoon fed,<br>in this neutered state of education leads to an extremely unhealthy lifestyle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And ends with not having a job,<br>when you get much, much older.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always advise everyone to talk to their elder selves,<br>and ask them what their regrets are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I leave it up to them to choose the epoch they visit,<br>but I trust eventually they will visit their elderly selves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education, hurts us across all our ages,<br>we need to plan for our entire life ahead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever your career is,<br>they will eventually force you out, don't count on them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Retirement plans are just another carrot and stick,<br>trust me you do not want to live on that 69-cent canned hot dog at the dollar store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is fine now,<br>but in your longest epoch, it is an insult.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Talk to your elderly selves,<br>ask them if they want you to have a fake education and mental health damaging career among desperate pretenders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or if they want you to learn to be able to stand on your own,<br>with art, music, sculpture, computers, adventure and books.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Know, that the Universe in its good nature,<br>will conspire to make your final age longer than all your other ages put together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This age, is meant to be an age of celebration of your achievement,<br>you are not to silently cradle a cheap gold plated watch as a reminder of your other ages.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are giggle,<br>and keep having more adventures.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am asking you to take to a Real Education<br>the beginning of which you will find in Narrated Books and Internet Video Tutorials.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(That teachers desperately holding on to what they will later discover to be their fraudulent careers,<br>and schools always hungry for the dollar but denying food to children with debt whilst <span>calling pizza a vegetable<sup>[1]</sup></span> as the parasites-i-mean principals get their golden parachutes,<br>have convinced you to be an ineffective and ridiculous form of education.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And narrated book after narrated book, and tutorial after tutorial,<br>awaken your genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And ensure, that an no point in your life,<br>will you serve for money, nor go hungry, or grow grim.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Genius is within you,<br>and once awakened, it will double with each new book and tutorial.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reject fake education,<br>learn in the sequence that fits you best, and at the pace that you find most comfortable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the Little Ones,<br>if you can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And remember,<br>with Knowledge comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes greatness.</div>
