    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Blender is a program for making 3D things,<br>3D game characters, and everything else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way things are done in the 3D world,<br>is that you start with a 3D primitive like a cube or a sphere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you apply modifications,<br>for example you can extrude faces of a cube with your mouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or you can apply an automatic modifier,<br>such as solidify.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which for an unknown reason,<br>will go inside your cube, and make a little home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will give the inside of a cube, walls,<br>perhaps it sees the faces of a solid cube as a thing to solidify.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can mix and match modifiers,<br>you can send a solidified cube into some other modifier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a side note, nobody yet knows,<br>what happens when you solidify a solidified cube - you get a second floor maybe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is maybe 50 modifiers that do odd,<br>but useful things like that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then there is this really crazy one,<br>called Geometry Nodes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you select your cube,<br>and apply a geometry node modifier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You get to see this beam of geometric information,<br>flowing from the input of the modifier to the output.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These beams or node connections, or node trees,<br>or geometry node blocks are not a new idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a drag and drop programming language,<br>not quite a proper user interface, and not a boring old programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is like a subway map,<br>you can follow the connections, to get a good picture of where things are happening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hollywood uses a similar language for advanced computer based scenes,<br>and previously Blender used something similar to color 3D objects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A language called pure data allows for music creation,<br>and a program called node red can help you program web servers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To return to our cube with,<br>a geometry nodes modifier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you cut the stream of the geometric information,<br>inside your Geometry nodes Modifier, the cube simply disappears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That input no longer reaches the output, the geometric information is cut,<br>and it won’t reach your screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here in this visual programming language,<br>you can also modify geometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you don’t get something for nothing,<br>like with the solidify modifier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now you have to really sit down,<br>with a pencil, and try to figure things out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is where this poem,<br>becomes a little bit unhinged, so better grab onto something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This sub modifier world,<br>this world of sub primitive things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Does not aim to speak the human language,<br>it won’t try to say solidify.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where you can sort of kind of hope to try, to imagine,<br>that something is about to become solid, somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here if you want to do something,<br>you have to look at other people doing stuff, and remember it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may have to read documentation,<br>which will for example seem to try to help you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For one it will break down long pages into section,<br>and sure as heck, they will start with a title, that someone careful highlighted, and made bold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But often just to mock you, to try to break you,<br>to try to make the documentation writers look special.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But after a while,<br>you will be able to do stuff.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can make your own solidify thingine, sort of,<br>if you take a cube, and and add a delete geometry node, and set it to delete faces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then convert the resulting lines into a curve,<br>which is more important than a line, and has a whole lot of tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you will find yourself, with a new starting point,<br>and lots of little tools for curve operations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here you can dress-up your curve (that was once a cube without faces),<br>with another curve, which will gently trace all the lines, and thus solidify your main curve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I did just that to create the decoration for a ring,<br>except that instead of a cube I used a low resolution sphere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you see, there is functionality in here,<br>but you have to know to delete some geometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you have to remember that curves,<br>are treated with extra care and respect, and have lots of little functions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Such as dressing up one curve with another,<br>a process that I have repeated, to create the main body of the ring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here, the curve that I was using to dress up my ring or curve-circle,<br>is something I manually created with my mouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted total control over how the ring feels,<br>and I actually repeated this step one more time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that I could fuse into the main body,<br>a much more geometric looking dress-up curve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way the inside of the ring will be very smooth,<br>while the outside will have an interesting polygonal pattern.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And finally I had to pause,<br>because when yo dress up a curve, it is a whole operation, all at once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But to position, the main decoration of the ring,<br>I only needed one spot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn’t want to slide around a ring, or dress up anything,<br>I just needed the correct coordinate on the top of this ring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Asking for top was too much,<br>I could have done it, but it would have added extra math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is a good idea to keep everything inside Geometry Nodes,<br>as simple as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, any addition to a ring,<br>is just about the size of a borough on a New York subway map.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So by the time you add five non-trivial things,<br>your program looks like the NYC Subway Map.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it turned out that I wouldn't get a coordinate for my ring decoration,<br>that is way too much to ask.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to gently build up information as you work with your curves,<br>and by the way curves are so special because they are simple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A mesh such as that of a small smooth torus,<br>can have hundreds of thousands of vectors of geometric information.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where if you start with a curve circle,<br>you will have 10 units of information.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In computer world everything starts at zero,<br>including bugs, called <span>Fence Post Problems<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, when you start at zero,<br>your number of cats is two, but you actually have a third cat...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or possibly you only have one cat,<br>or four.... maybe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anywho... zero is a really special number, because it is weird,<br>and in the beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So it is a really good spot,<br>to weld the decoration of a ring to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in geometry nodes you would say,<br>convert a copy of my curve to points.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another useful tool, a point, is a reference point,<br>it has XYZ, but also a radius, and you can attach custom calculations to it as of the recent Blender 3.2</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So here, to place that decoration at spot zero,<br>wherever it may be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We say, distribute decorations to point,<br>and this will immediate do what we are trying to avoid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will create as many copies of our decoration,<br>as there are points.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender, and operations in-general are at their simplest when they are complete,<br>because you never have to wonder what you got, you got all of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So now that the decoration has been distributed to all the points,<br>and we have the most uncomfortable ring int he world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We say, “Hey, distribute on point node”,<br>“I am going to select point zero”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whenever something is doing all it can,<br>there is usually a section option.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is a way of saying,<br>select only those part of a thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we select the part numbered zero by connecting boolean math node,<br>in the A filed we attach we attach INDEX, which holds index numbers of points.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then in the B field,<br>we enter our magical number zero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now the decorations are no longer distributed around the ring,<br>they are just at the point with index zero.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But now it gets worse,<br>because you want to have smaller supporting decorations on each side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you want them to grow smaller and smaller as they move away,<br>from the main decoration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no easy solution for this,<br>there is no trick you can pull of here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Right after we converted our curve to reference points,<br>we have to start doing math, with the cheerful little chipper math geometry nodes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which are the ultimate proof,<br>that math is fun and easy, when it is done right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us say we have ten reference points that we converted out cure into,<br>and no we will not call it N points, none of that nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to take this ten,<br>and make the center special.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because that is where the smaller decorations,<br>will pop up and start getting even smaller.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So to crack number 10 in half,<br>we have to position it over zero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then just throw it down,<br>as if the zero was the top of a pyramid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So to pull it back on a number scale,<br>so that the middle of the ten numbers is over zero, or becomes zero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to know the half of ten,<br>and then subtract it from ten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we are pulling the ten,<br>back into the minus world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now our numbers go from -5 to +5.<br>and here things get really easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we can just map -5 to +5,<br>with a map numbers node.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This node will ask us, what is the minimum from,<br>what is the maximum from, and we enter -5 and 5.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then it asks what is the minimum to,<br>and maximum to, and here we say -1 to 1.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will create a series of 10 floating point numbers, doubles,<br>that are now squished between -1 and 1.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And since we want things to be uniform on both sides of the ring,<br>we want to run the numbers through an absolute function - to get rid of that minus.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is an inversion that you have to perform here,<br>so that zeros become ones and ones become zeros.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we didn’t start at zero, we started at one, what was once minus one,<br>and then went over to one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means the zero that was the top of the pyramid,<br>is where index five is, not where index zero is, we want to keep the zeros together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which in the world of rings means, at the beginning and at the end,<br>at index 0 and also at index 9.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here finally we assign this number to the radius,<br>of our 3D reference point for safe keeping.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now as we instantiate decorations on the surface of our ring,<br>we have all the information we need to have a center decoration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And side decorations,<br>that gently get smaller, and smaller, and smaller.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What can I say,<br>if something is uniform like rings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then it is almost certainly,<br>programmable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And with a little bit of patience,<br>a bunch of naps, and sunny days.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can create a generator of rings,<br>generator of all kinds of blings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The details on such a ring,<br>are almost too much for today’s technology.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We may not have rocket packs,<br>but, lets face it, flying with a rocket on your back, is silly and weird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But what we have, is visual programming languages,<br>that are just enough to open a whole new world of creativity and invention, and bling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Procedural Modeling,<br>is here to stay...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From procedural jewelry to furniture, shoes and maybe haircuts,<br>and hats that perfectly match your haircuts so that everything has purrfect geometry.</div>
