    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot more to come,<br>because the more that Humanity creates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more room there is,<br>for growth.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is almost the same,<br>with what we create within ourselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you allow yourself,<br>to suspend the pursuit of grades, diplomas, and other approvals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And do something that you really like,<br>something that you often return to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will grow in that area,<br>and that often means that you can branch out towards new things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, if you starting with programming,<br>you can start learning Linux based operating systems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are starting with Art,<br>you may take to sculpture or 3D Modeling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you like music, or have favorite song writers,<br>surely you will like composing it too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps, best of all,<br>If you hate everything, and everything really-really sucks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means you are in your prime,<br>to become a travel writer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People will love hearing about your adventures, so much,<br>that they will not be able to fall asleep without your audio-books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The things that really matter,<br>are all the things that are most human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this also includes,<br>caring for Animals, Nature, Climate.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If that is still boring to you,<br>you may enjoy speculative thinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As far as creators are concerned,<br>that is an endless loop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As then you ask<br>who created the creator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there are questions,<br>that don’t end in loopty loops.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">For one life on earth, including us,<br>is constantly evolving.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite examples of evolution,<br>are more about showing that it is possible, rather than describing the real thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Australia had a huge plague of rabbits,<br>and used Myxomatosis a virus, to control them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But then the Rabbits that were immune to the virus,<br>begun spreading just as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the Australian rabbit population,<br>can be said to have undergone a genetic change in 2 years flat.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And in another popular story,<br>a very intelligent woman asked J.B.S Haldane a really good question.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately it included the words "cannot believe it is possible to go from a single cell to a complicated human body",<br>which got Haldane energized to make a funny reply in which he said "But madam, you did it yourself. And it only took you nine months."</div>

  <div class="paragraph">She was asking about the great precision,<br>and intricacies of the human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, actually, we are not designed to precision like clocks,<br>if that was the case we could easily interface with all the systems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are a work of chaos,<br>that is why Doctors can't create life from scratch, at least not without their wives noticing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is also why the Artificial Intelligence programmers, or statistics nerds,<br>can't precisely explain how their programs are arriving at semi correct results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a noisy, imprecise and chaotic processes,<br>it somewhat works, but you wouldn't want to debug the damn thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I searched a scholarly website for articles on "Artificial Intelligence Debugging",<br>one of the articles it burped up was titled "Taming Software With Hardware" - and I call that time to take a long break away from computers.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To return to life, growing things through chaos takes a lot,<br>requires a very large area and a very large stretch of time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact it can be said, it is not a waste of space,<br>if we never discover alien life, all that space was critical to test out all the possible combinations and permutations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that finally,<br>it occurred on at latest one planet in the universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And them the creatures there called it, Earth,<br>and promptly invented the <span>Melbourne Shuffle<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am certain that the Human Evolution,<br>is going through a gibberish selection phase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humans have it good, overall,<br>there is no huge pressure in any special direction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are going in all directions,<br>and on top of that we are all super smart with access to all kinds of information.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has always been the case,<br>we have not traveled a single line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in 65 million years,<br>we will have changed drastically.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As to make it seem,<br>that we have evolved along a singe line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There maybe a person reading this very poem,<br>65 million years from now with a smirk - Hello!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't that long ago that you could look someone in the eyes,<br>and recognize something different,.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not quite as familiar as,<br>what you have expected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I firmly believe,<br>that just that moment you’d also see a smile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A smile would say<br>“I know about my eyes, but I love them.”</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And beyond that...<br>it has been beautifully put...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the stars you see in the skies,<br>are just the sparks from the initial inflation of the Universe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We live at a time when we can see them,<br>which is precious.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually,<br>the night sky will light up with our own creations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will have interfaced with our biological systems,<br>and carefully underwent a process where there is no question that our mind is our own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But our bodies,<br>will be human made at first, and later probably more digital or virtual.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But here we will have spread across the milky way,<br>so there will be lots of different variations of humans evolving everywhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some will look just like us,<br>some will fit on a tiny microchip.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to travel vast distances,<br>when you are just a speck of dust.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you join me in the exercise of stepping outside of the universe,<br>you will see life, beautiful thinking inventive, unstoppable life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today, we only have a sample of one,<br>for me that is more than enough proof to see that there are countless others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For someone who is better at speculative thinking,<br>they may say “I’ll just wait five billion years”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The range of extremely unique Human life that has evolved in different places,<br>is all the proof of Alien life I’ll ever need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others, will look to the beginning of life it self,<br>Stromatolytes are either proof that life does not take very long to get started.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, that life, took a very long time to start, billions and billions of year,<br>but once it started, it spread across many clusters in many forms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of which is a speck of dust that is good at creating life<br>that precisely matches the chemical composition of the world its home asteroid whizzes by.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just add water, sunshine, and some electrolytes found in rocks everywhere,<br>and the moat of dust will become a sea of simple ever evolving organisms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After all, why go through all the trouble of suiting up to travel the distance,<br>when you can send somebody else there.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Finally, despite what the Scientists are saying,<br>the Universe does not end, we never run out of the subatomic particles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That we evolve beyond recognition, and take to the stars,<br>are Small Potatoes the Neverending Chronicle Of The Grand Human Adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more we expand,<br>the more room there is for growth.</div>
