      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The School Game; Or, Move Education Far And Away And From Any And All Influence Of Politics</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And to protect education, to make it permanently real,<br>we must remove it from the control of any and all politicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may seem like they may not directly influence what is taught,<br>at least in more developed nations - but that is false.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Raising tuition, is the same, or worse,<br>as teaching a fantasy, or opinion, over fact.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Underpaying teachers and lowering standards,<br>is the same as hiring actors that, eventually, merely pretend to teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The politicians don't have to ask to burn, or ban, or rewrite the books,<br>they just need to keep the prices high, and effort low, and the rest will take care of it self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For all the outstanding teachers in the world,<br>and their arguments against computerized education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are millions of teachers,<br>that cause overwhelming harm, that result s in people moving away from books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a try harder scenario,<br>there are only two kinds of education systems with nothing in between.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is either ineffective and fake,<br>or real and profound.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For a dictator to triumph,<br>they must collapse education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education does not collapse on its own,<br>it is our greatest invention - it is our natural direction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A well educated nation,<br>has high standards for political seats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A high demand for honesty and long term vision of the future,<br>and most importantly peer reviewed accomplishments, that eventually pave the way into politics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a nation with collapsed education,<br>you will find cult and nationalism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And again, that is not by chance,<br>it is a pre-requisite for political criminals to flourish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Any kind of educational interference,<br>will always lead to war, crime, and suffering.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The collapse of education is rarely about the burning of books,<br>and most often, imperceptible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy for well funded organizations,<br>to attack education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will prevent canceling of debt,<br>be it by nation-wide forgiveness or personal bankruptcy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or they will simply do nothing as tuition fees rise,<br>or, cause interference in hopes of lowering tuition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will do nothing to increase teacher pay,<br>nothing to encourage better teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will stand by as schools become ineffective,<br>and books get banned, and inner-city schools beg for funding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before long student loan debt becomes crushing,<br>and more and more people will see education as optional or unnecessary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By that time however it won't be real education,<br>it will be broken, ineffective, and pretty much, a theater.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will be a picture of education,<br>but beneath anything but.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A great part of wide spread cults of our world,<br>are simple answers to common questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the reward of heaven after a life of servitude,<br>to broken answers like, "...thus, god is above logic and reason".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These fantasies spread,<br>by filling-in, all the simple answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Collective fantasies, ease anxiety or suffering,<br>and bring a measure of pleasure, in what usually end up being dark ages and poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Such is the case with fake or ineffective schools,<br>for a price, they will sell the knowledge of some subject.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will back it up with a certificate,<br>and the fact that the graduate can't pass the test again, be damned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if a graduate can retake all the tests,<br>it does not mean that they have the necessary comprehension of their subjects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Having memorized a hundred formulas,<br>will not make a mathematician.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The group of people behind the imperceptible collapse of a nations education system,<br>will then have no trouble being elected into high positions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which will grant them even more power to corrupt,<br>and eventually lead to a crime family in charge of a nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This in turn leads to corruption, and complete bankruptcy,<br>which is them easily swept under the rug by means of war, under the cover of nationalism or some other low effort fantsy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By that time, propaganda and opinion will have long become louder,<br>than the voice of reason and hope of world peace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For an advanced nation, the defense against such an attack,<br>is found in protection of a real and profound educational system, and a culture and wisdom and knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here educated voters must greatly outnumber,<br>the uneducated, the easily intimidated, easily impressed, or easily mislead, the easily satisfied, and the easily sold out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People wishing to be in politics,<br>just wanting to make their way into it, to have followers, to have something to show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Have long prevented the rise of any advanced nation,<br>wherever we look we see nations ready for war, nations with warped criminal justice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We see mass incarceration,<br>in a nation whose amendment on slavery, still clearly states that a criminal is a slave.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only must we protect real education,<br>but we are yet to bring nations into such an advanced state.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must begin the creation of a real school that follows the student,<br>as soon as they begin caring about the world, as soon as they have questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we must make sure that the answers are the best that we have,<br>that a child is not made into a fool.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today school is seen as a place that a child goes to,<br>and a lot of children see it as stressful, fake, and punishing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Under the threat of poverty <span>students are forced to give up on real education<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and begin <span>a fantasy education that revolves around grades and graduations and tests they would fail if they had to retake again later on<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't trust the politics of a nation,<br>but we can trust peer reviewed automated school materials that function more like a game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than demanding obedience by marking a student down,<br>with a grade that eventually convinces them and their future employers they are unintelligent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We simply create a range of educational systems where students where students have to progress as if in a game,<br>where a door will be closed to them until they beat the level.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the levels or the curriculum,<br>must be always of their own choosing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Middle School, High School, College turned into a friendly and rewarding computer game,<br>when beat, a person can hold up the paths they traveled as great achievement, as something to be truly proud of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make no mistake, I am asking you to remove education,<br>from the hands of politicians, well meaning or not.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am asking you to put beautiful education in the hands of children,<br>so that they may grow independent of the artificial or political culture of whatever the place they happened to be born into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time they grow to make use of real education,<br>most of the world politicians will have long retired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It costs the world next to nothing to grant the younger generations,<br>a wiser, better, safer, and more peaceful world.</div>
