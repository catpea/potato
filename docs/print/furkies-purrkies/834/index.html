  <div class="paragraph">"Life moves pretty fast.<br>If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While not quite correct, this is one of my favorite High School movie quotes,<br>and a reason why I skipped many a class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just went,<br>to look around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite memory, is sitting on an old broken bench, on Brooklyn Bridge,<br>looking at Lady Liberty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We each have about a hundred years,<br>more than long enough for us to start forgetting our days.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So it is not a short amount of time,<br>but it is a limited amount of time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your bullies do not care, your employer does not care,<br>your schools and teachers do not care, and governments do not care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So unless you care,<br>your youth will be used to power a company and decades of your life may fade away.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One of the most helpful things a parent can do to help their children grow,<br>is to travel with them around the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not just go on temporary vacations,<br>but move around the world until they are old enough to protest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finding a temporary home in all the safe and beautiful places,<br>helps to grow and later flourish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Uluru, Pago Pago, Alaskan Glaciers, The Redwood Forests,<br>Grand Canyon, Brooklyn Bridge, Appalachian Trail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every once in a while someone must check up on Newton, at Westminster Abby,<br>and perhaps Nietzsche and few others at their own resting places, as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Years and years wandering the libraries, the birth and resting places of great beings,<br>their philosopher walks, the trails, and all the troubles and triumphs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Helps a person, get a good view of the world,<br>Frequently switching cultures, makes a person a Citizen; of the World.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty, stopped many a traveler,<br>it is a pretty scary thing of course.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning design, programming, maybe how to compose Techno in the Berlin School style,<br>will help a young person tutor and work remotely on the internet.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">As far as making education more real and relevant is concerned, there are many reasons,<br>why we must take to independent self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just that the world becomes a little bit safer and a bit more open,<br>when we walk away from tutorials or lectures that actually enable us useful and powerful, abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we gain wisdom in the process,<br>be it by pondering the universe with Newton at Westminster Abby, or by Whitman's Subtle Analogy, we simply enhance our mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To travel requires that the person actually wants to travel,<br>if they don't like the idea, then there is little benefit to be found.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is is why I mention parents and children traveling,<br>it is for the kids.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It encourage learning for real,<br>and becoming unstuck from any one culture in particular.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once we enter into out 20s, I recommend the Appalachian Trail,<br>if overwork did become a toxic problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again we have to be respectful of that 100 years granted to us,<br>we must avoid our things that dim our creative and drain us of energy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a result, we end up with room to ponder,<br>to read, listen or watch smart documentaries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And past the 20s, we have to learn even harder,<br>and make a series of serious attempts at launching little businesses with all our wonderful talents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, the more we know the faster we learn,<br>and learning on our own, is just standing in pursuit of our own curiosities, it is nothing like school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you accept the responsibility for your won education,<br>you learn a hundred times faster.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I suspect that there is still room here for the Great Trails,<br>section hiking, rather than through hiking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And at a much slower pace,<br>as this time it is more about refining our wisdom and learning towards writing books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Travel or no travel, becoming a self educated citizen of the world,<br>or an adventurer, or an athlete, or artist, or a professional troublemaker, so as long as it is with many a book in hand, is a great start to life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a great start to connect all powerful and meaningful things,<br>like creation of life-changing art, or writing and story telling, that makes lives a bit better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self Education is a sure formula to appreciate Humanityâ€™s greatest achievements,<br>and resume where the previews authors left off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Intellectual Independence,<br>is The Great Adventure in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
