    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I finally heard that fancy long sound Cicadas make,<br>I've been waiting forever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the years that I was settling down in New York,<br>they were up and about, and it was really nice to hear them again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been a big day for my inventions as well,<br>I've been able to minimize my mp3 player to a reasonable size.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though the smaller battery runs out in hours,<br>not days, but that is to be expected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have to tidy up some software,<br>I have to re-write monitoring of Bluetooth devices...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because the files that represent them on Linux,<br>are actually deleted when the Bluetooth device goes to sleep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I have to close the file-handle,<br>and go back into <span>waiting for input device mode, which I recently coded-in<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">It all just takes,<br>3 lines of code,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the gym,<br>I realized that <span>all my songs have to come in three speeds<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">140 beats per minute for lateral footwork,<br>where I twist my feet left and right, which isn't as fast as classical dance moves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">150 beats per minute,<br>which should be my standard 2.5 hour workout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(But isn't as I halved my workout time,<br>due to the Pandemic.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the upper speed of 160 beats,<br>which is for dancing without dumbbells.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am still working on my posture, so right now the little dumbbells,<br>and the mask, are making breathing more difficult.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to spend this year mostly on cardio,<br>and my goodness...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just couple of weeks ago, I had to look back on my bicycle,<br>to check for traffic...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And instead of getting a 120 degree view,<br>I caught 190 degree in the corner of my eye, so cardio is working out for me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just tried it again standing up, with my feet pointed forward,<br>I can see 190 degrees behind me by turning my knees torso, upper body and head - this can't be normal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, my music player, you see, is capable of manipulating the speed of music,<br>giving me rest, proper workout or high speed workout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a computation performed live,<br>the little Raspberry Pi computer can't handle that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a desktop computer can process 100 songs,<br>probably in 20 minutes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Which brings me to my song composition,<br>this is another thing that I figured out today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am able to enrich the background of the songs I compose,<br>by actually adding standard sea-like noise, and then adding some reverb, and filtering it down a little bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is very strange for me, I expected that background noise is best created with blended drums, base guitar,<br>but standard wet noise works very well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I first noticed use of noise in a re-make of Alan Walkers Faded, it is refereed to as uplifter and downlifter<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>and though those samples are richer and actually fade-in/fade-away, as far as my lightweight EDM goes, noise is noise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made a sample project, not really a song,<br>that show how the noise fills-in the background, I play that now;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(SAMPLE PLAYS)</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I left my favorite discovery, and milestone for last,<br>because as small as my Raspberry PI mp3 player is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It needs a purpose made case that can house the smaller battery,<br>that will take under account all the ports and a customizable push button that comes with the battery module.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which in the current Mark-II prototype serves as the play and shuffle button,<br>double press being a stop button, and long press being a sleep button.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is nothing I can create out of a stock <span>Aluminum Project Box/Enclosure<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and while this takes me to the 3D printed cased realms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first thing that comes to my mind is a CNC milling machine,<br>I am just crazy about aluminum, and how it dissipates heat, and how it looks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is something that is many months away,<br>as first I need to learn how to use Open Source CNC software.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just want to see simulated tool-paths on my screen,<br><span>I already have an SVG model of a case, there are many online<sup>[5]</sup></span> - but I know a huge tangent when I see one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I have built my MP3 player invention, I even went from Car Player to Workout Player,<br>but I got stopped by the world of 3D printers and CNC milling machines, as that is a whole new adventure, for another year.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is great though,<br>I went to the local hardware store today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I held Aluminum stock in my hands,<br>I searched for a nibbling tool, sheet metal tools...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I traced the micro-usb ports of an existing case I have,<br>I stared intently at my Dremel tool.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">To me all of this represents another semester of self education,<br>there are dozens of new things to learn here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is how it has always worked for me,<br>finish the little MP3 player and a great new world of CNC milling and 3D printing opens its gateways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is really hard to start watching lectures or tutorials about programming CNC machinery,<br>until there is that need, to finish a little project.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no education like self education, it is never about finishing some one thing,<br>but about all the branching things that we visit learn, along the way.</div>
