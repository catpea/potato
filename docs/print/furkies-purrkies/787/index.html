  <div class="paragraph">Before you know it,<br>you’ll build a scene you will wish to photo-manipulate, sketch, illustrate, and paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will be something cute an funny,<br>and extremely relaxing to work on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Photo manipulation,<br>actually includes painted elements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you are painting,<br>right on the photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sketching,<br>is about capturing the lines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or to be really precise,<br>what lines not to capture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You create line art,<br>that can stand on its own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But line art is also an important part,<br>of comics and illustration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you are coloring between the lines,<br>so to speak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can use flat colors, or gentle shadows,<br>or go all out like comics do and use gradients.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Illustrations are precious works of art,<br>they are not considered studies or notes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are exhibited,<br>right next to the paintings.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The final step here,<br>is my favorite, painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you can do a value study,<br>where you create a black and white painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And complete it by glazing it with color,<br>on a Layer set to color mode...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which uses values<br>from the black and white painting beneath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or use color directly,<br>which you may take from the photo-manipulation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or as you progress,<br>mix yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The secret to color mixing,<br>is relativity, sometimes termed local-color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are panting lips on a face,<br>you don’t reach for red.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you use the face color,<br>or mid-tone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And make it slightly rosier,<br>and repeat the process as needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see, you are using the local color,<br>the local shadow, value, mistiness, shadow, or sunshine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To paint the lips, you add rosiness to the local color,<br>think of it as working within the atmosphere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which brings us to the magical part,<br>all artists are magicians.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it glowing eyes, or a magical staff,<br>or skin that seems opal-like or pearl-like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you are conjuring up,<br>color magic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still rooted within the local color,<br>but no longer bound by the rules of reality.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It was Leonardo DaVinci, the person, not the Ninja Turtle who said:<br>“Art is never finished, only abandoned”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He does not mean that it is OK not to finish,<br>he is saying a good scene is like a friend and it should not be abandoned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, you can in fact finish a painting,<br>he was just being melodramatic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You finish it,<br>when you get it all perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the photo, the manipulation, and sketch,<br>to the illustration, the painting, and its magic.</div>
