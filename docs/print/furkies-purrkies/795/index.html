  <div class="paragraph">Your first and foremost obstacle is the liar,<br>also sometimes called an evil person, or hacker in the vile sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all know that the lairs do what they do,<br>out of illness; their minds have long unraveled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We may speak of how they want treasures,<br>or how they wish to be remembered by history.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is just our projection to account for their evil,<br>their evil has no logic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No more logic,<br>than a hunger for more pleasure they get from more evil and corruption.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In their minds they believe they are multiplying their power,<br>by not playing by the rules - but they are just hollow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They hate life, they don't understand it,<br>and stepping on other peoples heads gives them something to do.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we build cities,<br>the liars drive corruption into them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when we corner the rats,<br>they will tear the cities down entirely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a story as old,<br>as humanity it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even this story,<br>is never told without lies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each retelling,<br>has another liar slithering in between the pages of history.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Liars use multiple steps,<br>which blur and hide their true intentions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And sometimes bury their evil,<br>in plausible deniability.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can also spreed their misery organically,<br>like a slime, growing where it is merely most advantageous.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They rob banks, or pinch pennies of the poor,<br>simple because that is where the money is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example any and all attacks at the modern world, human rights, or the undoing of good ideas,<br>is simply is a cheap voter grab.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars are saying things that are opposite to progress,<br>to gather up uneducated voters on the opposing side - that is all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are tapping into the opposition,<br>and merely using it to slither into politics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This it will be obscured,<br>by them taking advantage of random things along the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Randomly emerging communities,<br>randomly occurring events during their manipulations.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That liars are successful,<br>depends on mislead or uneducated voters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And uneducated voters,<br>are a product of ineffective schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy education, or any kind of in-authenticity,<br>is the fuel of a liar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It fuels those who seek to be elected,<br>and those who prefer to slither in darkness.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Historically where we aimed for Love and Peace,<br>liars, simply manufactured, enemies and war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lairs attack our foundation,<br>the places that we have long risen above.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like the world of uneducated people,<br>or those who are swayed by imaginary creatures with superpowers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know, this, for all the canvas attacked with razor blades and fire,<br>or in ways that even the best colors cannot mend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those who have risen,<br>would always rebuild.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The masterpiece would always get repainted from scratch,<br>and the creator would never sink down to the liarâ€™s tactics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those who rise,<br>rise to bring joy to the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody is born a liar,<br>it is a state that a desperate or broken person is pressed into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars should be prevented from existing,<br>in the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is why, we need to learn for real,<br>why we must aim for Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness for all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well educated voters and politicians,<br>will swiftly put an end to poverty, and war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually in your collective wisdom,<br>you will create a world of politics that cleverly denies, the liar or dictator any and all entry.</div>
