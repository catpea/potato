      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Quest For Real Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We know all human being are equally intelligent,<br>it is that that each has a different path through Knowledge and Curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Standardizing that path, inducing memorization,<br>and calling that an education, is madness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians and principals get re-elected, teachers keep on pretending to be relevant, parents ship their kids off into college, and unforgivable college debt.<br>this is not who we are, and this is not how the world will advance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Human Beings require real Education,<br>and not any set of subjects in particular - there are no subject divisions in real life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is above all, relevant, to the person learning,<br>nobody learning programming has the time to consider the powerhouse of the cell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Very often people are told to stop learning and get into organized education,<br>where they will start temporary memorizing disconnected facts for imaginary grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People doing this pushing are tricked into thinking that is the right thing to do,<br>but that ends real education, and intellectually blinds the student, sometimes permanently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Taking a person’s education away,<br>is a terrible thing to do, it is an unforgivable thing as without a real education they can’t advance in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are all extremely smart,<br>if we are not mislead we take to self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We learn what is relevant and interesting to us,<br>at a pace that fully satisfies our curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can only really learn in a sequence that is unique to us,<br>that matches what we have learned thus far and what we are comfortable with, and what our next interests are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education, is beautiful, and it it pure joy,<br>the reward is all the new things we can create, with our hands or mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we don’t understand something we make infinite room to understand it,<br>we may push our current pursuits aside and set off on an adventure within adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things that call to us, are also the things that we will frequently return to,<br>and thus continue learning and refine our talents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Grades, subject divisions, timed periods of learning, tests to test the incomprehensible,<br>are toxic for real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to jump the fake education hoops and still learn something useful,<br>we can’t just hope to stop learning for real - for the duration of the time that we spend pretending to learn in school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending will drain the passion and patience necessary for Real Education to grow,<br>to expand, to call to us, and to inspire us with new curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to remind the little ones that they all extremely smart,<br>but they are under attack by poverty and by extension fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing they really have to start with is Narrated Books at the Library,<br>and ad infested video tutorials on the internet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is a pretty sad start,<br>but things will improve quickly with real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from relevant and meaningful biographies,<br>goes a long way to create powerful independent thinkers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For some it maybe hard to see the benefit at first, to believe that mere books can change lives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But books don’t just give us new information to work with,<br>but transform our minds, books extend our abilities, enhance our minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is not simply about having more knowledge,<br>but about improved and enhanced understanding of everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When tough kids in a bad school say that education does nothing for me,<br>they don’t know that the education they are getting is completely fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the education they know, is not the real education that they should be getting,<br>the real education that is their inheritance, their treasure, and their right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all need to fight for real education,<br>we need to stand up for ourselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can’t pretend we are learning just to get a diploma,<br>there is no time for that in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need real lessons, that make our minds better and stronger,<br>that fill us with Knowledge and Wisdom, and Greatness - we are all meant to become Great Beings.</div>
