    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was beginning my daily adventure,<br>by heading out whichever way on the I-275 Bicycle Trail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is this one steep hill that climbs over the tracks,<br>I remember well how I had difficulty rolling all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've noticed a couple of new fitness nerds pushing their bicycles up,<br>and I got off mine as to give them room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They noticed me, and I begun complaining how steep this hill is,<br>and that I can never quite make it up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We had a chuckle, and I told them about Ludington,<br>and Nordhouse Dunes especially.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I said that that climbing dunes all day,<br>is a wonderful way to lose a lot of weight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The change of environment also causes the change of diet,<br>and somehow lessens appetite, as it is a vacation after all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They, listened carefully,<br>and said that they will think about camping adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I might have added in that getting rid of kitchen appliances,<br>is good idea too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What I didn't mention, is that,<br>getting rid of appliances is also a crazy idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I didn't have the heart to say,<br>that camping or fitness vacations last a long time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Months,<br>maybe years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And so the mad idea of Adventure Fitness,<br>was born.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I define it as,<br>never quite returning from a healthy vacation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This sounds more suspicions than it really is,<br>long before the dietary benefits, the Call Of The Wild comes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And though we return from that type of vacation,<br>we return as nature, not cogs in some machine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, from a more poetic perspective,<br>returning changed is like never returning at all - in a way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long before the adventurer learns to understand they must stay on their Fitness Adventure,<br>they become wild things, in the most cheerful and wonderful of ways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Artists, musicians, marvelous hooligans,<br>royal vagabonds, and of course <span>Great Beings<sup>[1]</sup></span>, those <span>touched by the Wisdom of Nature<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sorry I knew not to tell them,<br>not to return from their vacation but keep heading to the next and next adventure, and then some.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They bravely made it up that first hill,<br>they were warriors now, and I hoped that they kept on going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I hope that today, they are healthy,<br>and appreciate that all their weight actually added to give them enormous muscles that now show though.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is Adventure Fitness, a one way road towards Health and Adventure,<br>away from stressful jobs, toxic environments, and that deadly combination of stress, couch, dinner and TV.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately, the first step to Adventure Fitness,<br>is still to unplug and get rid of kitchen appliances, and that dumb TV.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first step to the great adventure trails,<br>does not begin on the trail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It begins,<br>by getting rid of the appliances, including fridge and stove.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the second step is shopping for adventure equipment,<br>and <span>starting with short and beautiful trails<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Obesity is a serous issue,<br>that requires Doctor's help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However a healthier lifestyle, does not mean a more difficult lifestyle,<br>as it is standing invitation to a lifetime of Great Adventures.</div>
