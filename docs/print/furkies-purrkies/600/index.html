  <div class="paragraph">Naked Emperors are, what Naked Emperors do,<br>don't let them fool you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually it all runs its course,<br>and even then they will only rule so long with force.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We see this in how Rome met its fate,<br>where wisdom was seen as a crime against state.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is no arguing that,<br>either have real education or fall flat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">I understand that nobody likes transformations,<br>but you will not know any of these nations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To put it mildly, we are not in range,<br>to witness the change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These ideas, the world, and nations,<br>are for the youngest of our generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have to be simple, tested and clear,<br>so that they may proceed without fear.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing old,<br>about the design of the new world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crime must be prevented at all cost,<br>because later too much lost.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thus Powerful Education, Therapy, and Mental Health come first,<br>the new schools must create a real scientific thirst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is important to protect science,<br>as it will ensure multiple pathways to self reliance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But History Of Philosophy is above all else,<br>as it helps us rise out of our shells.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Indoctrination will be seen as a crime,<br>we must set aims on wisdom this time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Human Beings are extremely special and each is unique,<br>we require a very particular learning technique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There must be no stress or punishment in class,<br>and teachers are forbidden to threaten or harass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each student has a unique path and pace,<br>and all student must be taught on case by case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education, grades and testing, is fraud,<br>and should be banned if not outlawed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no one school approach that will work for all,<br>but each student has a unique way to reach their goal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each area of interest should have multiple doors,<br>and emerge multiple lessons as the student explores.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To ensure accessibility, automation, tooling, and quality,<br><span>the automated parts of schools should be built on a text-based virtual reality<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than the teachers leading the lessons for all,<br>the students will be solving puzzles in a virtual dungeon crawl.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All of this has to be editable, open source, and free,<br>so that it is allowed to grow like a great tree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">As to solving poverty, one hundred dollars a day for one hundred years,<br>is three million and six hundred fifty thousand dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The new economy will grant each person this amount,<br>to spend across a lifetime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The card just comes with a 24 hour hundred dollar spending limit to ensure stability,<br>erasing a great deal of human suffering and vulnerability.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thus the new world will learn to use a new paradigm,<br>when dealing with crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Criminals will require understanding, therapy and education,<br>proper care for those in need is one of the pillars of a stable nation.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The laws require a virtual world where they can be defined,<br>to that the case can be simulated, contextualized and aligned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a world where crime is seen as mental breakdown,<br>human beings, not inmates, are built up, not stripped down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It takes millions of people to build a stable new world,<br>and it requires retiring whatever has run its course and became broken or old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But designing a world top down,<br>starts with just three things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The formula of 365 days x one hundred dollars x one hundred years,<br>to erase all fears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A small plastic debit card with the symbol of a heart,<br>converting the mistake of money to one of our greatest works of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And an earth passport, to remind us that we are the same, that we are one,<br>that we need to erase divisions, as we are one family under the sun.</div>
