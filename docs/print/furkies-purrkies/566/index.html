    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who knows why we are born with an ember and not aglow with a fire,<br>why to wisdom me must choose to aspire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe because we are each to light the fire on our own,<br>maybe we need to wait until we are fully grown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe it is just that it is a choice,<br>but it is good that we can all have a voice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever the reasons, to make it burn or leave it glow,<br>there is something that each of us should know.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Decisions that deal with our soul,<br>require that we witness nature whole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that means,<br>you need to set aside machines and computer screens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you don't just go into the mountains, but also is must snow,<br>and the cold wind should also blow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need to cross the mountains to learn to see,<br>just like you don't have swim across the sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A cabin will do,<br>and grab a fine boat for the oceans too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And be prepared to sail to a real island,<br>better yet, just as soon as you descend down from the highland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yes you need to see the desert too,<br>anyone of them will do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be best if the cacti flowered for you,<br>I hope you understand, I hope you do.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We take care of nature, and she takes care of us,<br>it is not even that big of a fuss.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We should all know that<br>the office is only good for a few years, so much for that diploma and a hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness isn't really optional anymore,<br>it is just not very nice to ask for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need to grant ourselves a real education,<br>no matter what city, state or nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then we need Wisdom to grow from that,<br>and then greatness to follow, no matter what.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is time for Humanity to emphasize learning to see,<br>to see the nature, the nurture and the future, that it all just a delicate tree.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We should never have delayed by tolerating the political crooks,<br>now we really need to get to the books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This time is not just about reading on listening to them,<br>now we must write them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>We are from nature, from the seas, and the mountains, and the desert too<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and you can't evolve from that no matter what you do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is something I must ask you to do,<br>prepare a backpack, you can tell yourself it is not even for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And keep it right by the door,<br>it may take a week or two, or four.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But eventually, on a day full of pointless overwork and woe,<br>you'll just grab it, and go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The backpack is a contract with nature, and the stars,<br>and it is purely about your wisdom and your memoirs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your journals of day to day adventure,<br>as you take to the arms of Mother Nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She will light your glowing ember,<br>even if it is <span>damp and drizzly November<sup>[2]</sup></span>, and especially if it is <span>deep and dark December<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Get a hold of the trail<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>even if you think you are going to fail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fill a journal after journal from the mountains to the sea,<br>may your wisdom set the world free, and grow, grow endlessly.</div>
