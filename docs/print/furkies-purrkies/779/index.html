  <div class="paragraph">Sorry, the weather won't turn,<br>until after, the Groundhog gets his tax return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our Dear Groundhog Leader,<br>may be a mind reader.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All hail, the Beautiful Groundhog,<br>the leader of all, from human to dog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like Santa he maybe able to hear your every thought,<br>and he probably listens a lot.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The older he gets,<br>the less he cares, the less regrets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe he feels he was always too nice,<br>so now he is bringing the ice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ice age - that is,<br>because control over weather seems to be his.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The weather will only turn,<br>after he gets his tax return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And he is going to need a quite a penny,<br>as right now he doesn't have very many.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This worst of all dictators,<br>probably eats a lot of tators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And due to the upcoming drought,<br>he's probably considering purchasing some trout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I suppose he wants his tax money,<br>so he can get shiny diamonds his Lovely Honey.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what Groundhog Lady doesn't like bling,<br>especially once the Spring is in full swing.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Our Groundhog,<br>lives in a cute little home beneath a mighty ol log.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the the colder the weather,<br>the closer she will snuggle together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So he's is simply extending the weeks,<br>because he deeply loves Sweet Cheeks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But with a potato, a handful of diamonds, and a trout or two,<br>he will come through.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will eventually stop snowing,<br>therefore, Oh the All Knowing.</div>
