    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of real education,<br>has been behind wrong doing in every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is our most important invention,<br>our only means of crime and war prevention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us set students free,<br>form all the worldâ€™s poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us end poverty and all the charades,<br>and force school to pay, pay, for grades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must all aim to agree,<br>that real education makes the world open and free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us eliminate poverty by paying for education,<br>let us build a new world, by uniting every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us call it Earth and live without war,<br>instead of fighting ... let us learn, more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stop letting liars tell you that "peace cannot be",<br>because they are deaf, dumb and cannot see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will lie to keep the world chained,<br>so as long as there is still a living soul to be drained.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars are broken and cannot think for real,<br>some turn off their hearts and cannot even feel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, and it goes without a say,<br>that we must learn for real, each and every day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we must remember that schools may never work,<br>and that we all have an odd quirk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are stuck under this shadow,<br>only making decisions based on what we know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So we have to lean as much as we can,<br>to dream up the wisest plan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not just for learning more,<br>though that should be at its core.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But for helping the world grow too,<br>as it too needs a greater view.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not tolerate broken schools,<br>anymore than we use broken tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of real education is madness,<br>and it can only take us towards great sadness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real,<br>is a huge deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is such a huge deal,<br>that is does not even matter if schools are real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We should learn on our own anyway,<br>that is the most trustworthy way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever lies stand in your way,<br>you have to kick them away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we need real knowledge to be strong,<br>it is broken school is where things go wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That quirk of ours does not let us see,<br>how fake schools force us all to disagree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Parents, do not trust a broken school,<br>students learning on their own, should be the rule.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is even worse in broken nations where corrupt schools,<br>are little more than propaganda tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make no mistake schools should pay for grades,<br>rather than send children into war or military parades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Early life is meant to be beautiful,<br>not turn a trusting student into a tool.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education sets us all truly free,<br>and it helps the World converge on wisdom and finally agree.</div>
