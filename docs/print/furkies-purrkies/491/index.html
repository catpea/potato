  <div class="paragraph">I suppose this is something that the birds have missed,<br>I am a really nice cyclist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the people I warn of the angry birds,<br>can't believe my words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have never experienced any attacks,<br>I am the only one paying the bird toll and tax.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I bicycled back there today,<br>and the moment I looked up they all flew away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is summer and I wanted to get a bit tanned,<br>so I cut myself a switch, held a twig in my hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is no way to ride a bicycle,<br>why are their hearts as cold as an icicle.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think they saw my twig and a half,<br>and just had a good laugh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Birds are evolved from Dinosaurs, aka Terrible Lizards,<br>maybe that is why they are so up in their gizzards,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It certainly isn't my fault,<br>and no man should suffer birds assault.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I ride by that ugly tree every year,<br>and I think what these birds want is just fear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are certainly not protecting their little babies,<br>I think they all just have rabies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or just entertain themselves with those that strike some chord,<br>because they are really bored.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When I got by passed them without attack, I smirked,<br>that twig with me worked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, if you are ever bothered by bird or two,<br>you don't have to be blue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the birds come just get mad,<br>and <span>wiggle a little twig above your head<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
