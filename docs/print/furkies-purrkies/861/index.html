    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't give up on Knowledge and Wisdom, don't let fake schools get to you, or derail you,<br>the cure to broken schools, is self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This can sweetly begin with modern narrated books that are thought of as priceless,<br>by all the world intellectuals.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to talk about fixing things,<br>because that is usually where all the fruitcakes hang out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if your aim is self empowerment and intellectual independence,<br>by means of powerful life-long self education, then it is OK.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can see that schools do not seem care about life-long results,<br>institutions may not be able to care about issues that lead to their creation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps for as long as everyone is stuck in poverty,<br>all aims will be misaligned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without a well educated world,<br>there is little room for conversation about powerful universal income and exit from poverty</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And although aims may misalign,<br>and perhaps it maybe impossible to learn in face of poverty, due to stress and fear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are always exceptions, and thus, those who lead the change,<br>and here the exceptional individuals that emerge from self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are likely Humanity's fastest and best,<br>path towards building real schools that provide real and life-long results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, what students seem to be doing is entrusting their minds to the two groups of people,<br>that that failed to address poverty and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war, again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers and politicians, who are only as equipped to handle reality,<br>as the schools that they have attended.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If those schools were broken or ineffective,<br>then so is their impression of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look at the damage that has been done already,<br>schools attempt to teach by punishing with bad grades or by holding people back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But stress largely prevents learning, as true learning calls for joy,<br>and punishment can only force students into desperate memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Students have been tricked so bad,<br>that it sounds unbelievable when we think of the truth:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That all minds are genius minds,<br>that every mind is as capable as those of Philosophers, Artists, Hackers, and Scientists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps it is as simple as the idea, that schools would have a very difficult time making money,<br>if all the students realized, that teachers just slow them all down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are being slowly convinced that your grade is a measure of your intelligence,<br>and that blind obedience is the cure for your bad grades...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then find a better teacher, a better school,<br>because that is hon how education works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is meant to be a happy adventure,<br>through all your most bountiful and curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you cant get to real and effective education,<br>then accept the responsibility for authentic and powerful self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education starts with books that are held in high esteem by all the worlds intellectuals,<br>and the understanding that you cannot learn, what you are not yet curious about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Start in the beginning, with whatever curiosity is calling to you,<br>and knowing, that you are a genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you are a Royalty,<br>and the hope and dream of a better future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your intelligence has no limit,<br>and the world is yours to explore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only key you need,<br>is the knowledge that to grow up, means...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To grow all the way up,<br>until you become a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Afterword: If you have no idea where to start,<br>then surround yourself with narrated books start with the top sellers in non-fiction and science category.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then begin learning <span>Digital Painting with Krita<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>especially <span>make use of the reference images tool<sup>[2]</sup></span>, it is how <span>the most powerful artists do it<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when you need a break, take to <span>3D Modeling and Printing with Blender<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and/or <span>Programming with modern JavaScript<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though banks have already bet on you, no career path is perfect, nor is it ever guaranteed,<br>but Art, Design, Industrial Design, and Software Development, are all very sturdy bets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And do not forget, that a Student Loan is a special kind of loan,<br>if you fail to pay it off, it will be extracted from your paycheck, these loans are not forgivable by bankruptcy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The banks have bet on both, on your failure and success,<br>and in your failure they will take money when you need it the most.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must ensure that your education is meaningful,<br>powerful, authentic and real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must advance past global poverty,<br>that holds us all hostage and often leads to war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Meaningful self education that leads to the creation of more powerful schools,<br>all around the globe, is our finest way forward.</div>
