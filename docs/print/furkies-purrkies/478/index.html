    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful when listening to advice,<br>as every Human Being has their own path of curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you should be just as careful when it comes to culture,<br>as the parts of you that change depending on what culture you are born to, are probably temporary.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you get pushed off your own path,<br>you will enter a lifeline that will be alien to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Complexity of life arranges for emergence of inspirational lessons, powerful observations, and helpful signals,<br>but we have to walk the paths that we feel strongly and passionately about, to learn the most.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't remember where or even if I heard it somewhere (though probably did),<br>but from time to time when questions of advice come up...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage people to ask <em>their elder selves</em> what their regrets maybe,<br>picturing our elder selves can gently guide us onto the correct paths, somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just in case you are still young, Dear Reader,<br>you should know, that even back when we are young, we already have a <em>mighty grasp</em> on powerful wisdom.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I just followed my own little road,<br>road of adventure, archaeology, programming, and freedom from any and all bullies and bull$hit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know how I did it,<br>but now, that I have slowed down to write.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I see my adventures as being on par with anything that Indiana Jones could live through,<br>I had so many hot flashes from near wild animal attacks, that they just became another way of measuring my adventures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And short of <span>losing my most precious artifact<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>my archaeology was always on point, to this day I keep an eye on museums.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And my computer programming has been steadily advancing since I was ten or so,<br>I learn about all the things that fit me, at the pace that suits me best, and in the perfect sequence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I totally <span>understand what computer inventors are talking about<sup>[2]</sup></span>, but like the critics I have also noticed,<br>that <span>there are a lot of broken things in the computer world<sup>[3]</sup></span> that almost everybody is ignoring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of software, I like to ask myself what is the minimum useful implementation of all the programs that we use,<br>and it is often very sad and shocking how over-engineered, and bloated, and slow, and heavy all the software it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I look at simple command line menus on my computer, I see the stark difference,<br>the first person to minify all the programs to a useful minimum will surely become internet famous.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, I just walked my own road, making my own observations, and learning my own lessons,<br>I didn't allow anybody to push me away from all my tiny and delicate curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we like something, and follow it,<br>somehow it always becomes far greater than what initially called to us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is never just art, or museum, or nature,<br>it is more like a pyramid, and you just keep going and going and going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And before you know it,<br>it turns out, that you know a whole million, of somewhat-interesting stories.</div>
