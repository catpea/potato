    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would be so nice if we could hope to repair High School,<br>but there is too much paperwork, and far too many broken promises.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The minds of the Students and the younger generations,<br>are far too precious to even consider staining with ineffective education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this text I use the word talent,<br>the way it should be used.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I indicate a thing, that is to be learned and proud of,<br>not the myth of being born with some special ability.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, computer Game Making Talent can cover most of High School Math,<br>and Building Math Visualizations and Puzzles will get the rest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However, not everyone will be interested in making games,<br>some people may prefer Electronics or even Nerf Gun-turrets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will cover a smaller portion of Math,<br>and that is OK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we cannot do is use something as off-topic as the,<br>"<span>Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program<sup>[1]</sup></span>".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which contains categories that are just not relevant to anything,<br>Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics-and-Probability, and <span>how to pretend to learn without taking anything away<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only decent explanation the Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program builders can conjure up,<br>is "<span>Math helps us have better problem-solving skills<sup>[3]</sup></span>".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But these isolated, abstract, reduced to the bare bone, insipid subject divisions have to go,<br>because they only force students into memorization, and produce stupid politicians that don't know math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Passing standardized tests,<br>is a useless talent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Taking to programming, with a long exploration of <span>p5.js<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and then Command Line Programs, HTTPS Servers (a very simple and cool thing)...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Databases (which are simpler than excel),<br>Reactive Frameworks (React, VueJs, Svelte), and finally cross-platform User Interface Design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Does not just result in getting a job,<br>but slowly <span>assembling a small startup<sup>[5]</sup></span>, or a range of creative side projects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics as it is taught in High School,<br>is very weak compared to programming that can set a person free from poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics taught right,<br>on a collaborative Wikipedia-like P5.js driven 9-12 Mathematics Program delivered as an interactive game.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is fine, except for the fact that a more meaningful education,<br>also helps people out of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Subject based education,<br>is an insult to the younger generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in fact oils the cogs of the machinery that <span>strips them off their savings<sup>[6]</sup></span><br>and forces them into <span>taking out unforgivable student loans<sup>[7]</sup></span>..</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Incompetent politicians, lukewarm teachers, and irrelevant lectures,<br>only combine to halt humanity's progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we stand still, and uneducated,<br>we get taken advantage of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For two thousand years it has been know that <span>lead is bad<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br><span>but we put it in our gasoline<sup>[9]</sup></span>, even though there was an ever so slightly expensive alternative that was safer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This pattern continues with <span>Neonicotinoids<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>continued emission of <span>CFCs<sup>[11]</sup></span>, and <span>PFAS<sup>[12]</sup></span>, which <span>you should already consider, when moving<sup>[13]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A talent based education,<br>simple reflects the way we learn in the real world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A subject based education,<br>is just easy to cram for, and teaches little.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are better, than Using schools as baby sitters,<br>and tolerating ineffective education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are better than acting as if politicians can fix it,<br>all the while pushing students into debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is time to create a number of open computer based education systems,<br>that aim to deliver real results for a change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools, <span>where students expand their curiosities and talents, one meaningful project at a time<sup>[14]</sup></span>,<br>art and science is everywhere, it is best studied in context of something meaningful.</div>
