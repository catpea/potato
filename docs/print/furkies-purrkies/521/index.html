      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Strange Little List Of Artsy Things</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is of course but one rule in art:<br>Don't Stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In deed, what makes an artist,<br>is frequent practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is all,<br>there is to it,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even so, what follows is a few thoughts I jotted this evening,<br>in anticipation of this poem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An easel, especially a portable one, meant for adventures,<br>can't be driven to the art destination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't just whip your easel out of the car,<br>and pop it up in front of some vista.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to explain,<br>but you have to park somewhere far, down the hill.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can ride a bicycle, or huff an puff some other way,<br>but you can't use a car to get all the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The practice of art,<br>requires great Dignity and Nobility.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long before you pounce at art,<br>take time to learn how and what time of day you can take good photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Always take more photos than you will ever need,<br>you just never know the smiles you can discover in there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A photo is a magical connection to the subject of your drawing or painting,<br>instead of bicycling all the way out there again, you can just pull it out of your pocket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Somewhere on my way to Nordhouse, I had the impossible luck of having come across,<br>an old Black and White postcard of Mona Lisa.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was all I needed,<br>to invent my way towards art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Searching for color and gradient combinations is a big deal,<br>you need journals and posters and entire painting dedicated to the exploration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But take the time to look at history of color as well,<br>history of oil painting in general.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not always a good thing to say that one should only use the most beautiful of colors,<br>but if you are to replicate colors of your source image perfectly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you sit down to your painting,<br><span>grab a large full color printout of your subject, place a glass pane over it, and test your colors on the glass<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also consider painting for the colors sake,<br>it is such a happy thing to have your breath taken away by a painting with colors from another world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Trace, trace, trace, copy, and project you images with office projectors,<br>invent countless ways of transferring shapes with precision to your painting or drawing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless you are a medical student, there is little to be found by first memorizing everything to perfection,<br>memorize your shapes and their needs by tracing thousands of portraits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And tell everyone about it, invite them to the world of Art,<br>make them wonder, and daydream about becoming artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take time to prepare an entire book of tracings,<br>both for practice and for meditation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is so nice to have everything ready, to just sit down and doodle,<br>while you sip your white mocha.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, just because you are at a beautiful location,<br>it does not mean that you have to paint what is right there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One time, I was at the <span>Pinckney Recreation Area<sup>[2]</sup></span>, which has a pretty lake,<br>with a neat woodland horizon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember being lost in my thoughts as I've noticed,<br>that they have recently installed Bear proof garbage cans.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It just blew my mind, that somewhere out there could be a bear,<br>eyeing me for a beefy succulent treat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for the hell in me, I just couldn't open any for those cans,<br>no matter how many times I read the instructions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before I could stop myself,<br>from pondering if perhaps I was the bear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've noticed a mother and child waddling my way,<br>in a way that bespoke "C'mon lets see his painting."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Normally this would be strange, as from where they were standing,<br>one could assume that they were closer to the scene that I was painting than I was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However, this time,<br>I went to the lake for the purpose of not painting the lake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before I knew it, the mother was behind me, heavily breathing on my neck,<br>and intently staring at my painting, with a grimace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The child was still huffing and puffing up the hill,<br>and she slid down there, to get him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I could hear her saying, that it was <em>not</em> the lake,<br>that it is an "Inebriated Dog".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which it was - I was painting <span>Brian Griffin<sup>[3]</sup></span> the white drunk intellectual Labrador that speaks English,<br>in Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I haven't sat down a TV in 20 years, I don't think I ever watched a full episode,<br>but I figured I should paint the Dog, because it seemed smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is my final piece of advice,<br>it is good to have rules, because Art rules are meant to be broken.</div>
