    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All it took was real education,<br>and a single glance at mass incarceration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians were misled, not just lying,<br>they were unable to process that people were dying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A group of nerds got together and started coding,<br>presidents started calling before the program was even loading.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were many nations interested in the system,<br>they all suffered a dying ecosystem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no trick to the program,<br>and everything had a diagram.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The rules were simple at first,<br>they created a real outburst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They helped people understand the sanctity of life,<br>they cut through dark ages like a knife.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once it was declared that a human is sacred,<br>the system forbade all variations of hatred.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once it completed the configuration,<br>and printing out of the declaration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People in prisons were transferred to hospitals that cared,<br>and communities where they could learn, move on, and stop being scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The computer did not have all the answers at first,<br>and it needed voters, and ones that could not be coerced.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It didn't know what a school really was,<br>but it could test if the voters knew the laws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It used groups of random educated voters as a thinking module,<br>the nerds thought that was really ^cool^.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It worked for the smaller nations and it got them going,<br>people grew stronger and it was showing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The larger nations that first laughed the program out,<br>couldn't wrap their minds around it and couldn't figure anything out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well it turned out that the leading politicians didn't have a plan,<br>they couldn't fix anything, they only lied they can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once the schools stopped teaching and forced the students to start pretending,<br>it didn't even matter whether or not anybody was attending.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the computer program solved all that,<br>by first asking the voters where the problems were at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then break everything down into job and sub-jobs, and sub-sub-jobs that first needed to get done,<br>and it would make a million voters work as one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first thing people wanted was real education,<br>so the computer asked the entire nation:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hello, please vote on the definition of real education."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People decided it was "Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.",<br>and all it took was a single button press.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few more questions and people decided grades were useless,<br>as each classroom should learn to operate a business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And so it was, becoming a particular businessperson dictated the area of study,<br>the lectures were never confusing or muddy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students were driven out of poverty with their own education,<br>that turned out to be all that was required to pull a nation out of stagnation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An then the politicians finally figured out the part that was really tricky,<br>the part that made their <span>hands all sticky<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The program eliminated the need for representatives of all kinds,<br>because it directly spoke to the educated voters' minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So what was confusing them about these new conditions,<br>is that the program eliminated the need for the politicians.</div>
