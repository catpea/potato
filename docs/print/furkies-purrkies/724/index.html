  <div class="paragraph">I am sitting at home,<br>waiting for Spring to come.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not sure what I will do on the first day,<br>but I hope it arrives without delay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I know a year is born on new year's day,<br>I think of first day of Spring a the true birthday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is tough to wait for the first Spring day,<br>so when it gets here, it kind of feels like the true birthday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps this <strong>is</strong> somewhat silly,<br>but January ... is <strong>always</strong> chilly.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Though there are still many things that remain unclear,<br>I learned how to paint this year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I sad town to finish my first portrait today,<br>it is based on a photo I took on a Spring day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was so warm and sunny,<br>it is not even funny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was riding my bicycle through a woodland trail,<br>at a speed but a little faster than a snail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I took the photo just in case the winter got too long,<br>but it went by quickly, and wasn't that strong.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I admit, I painted extra flowers in the background,<br>I am just ready for Spring to come around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bet the Spring weather will be extra nice,<br>perhaps we'll get some warm rains once or twice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I already saw a sandhill crane land in the melting snow,<br>she's a few days early - if you ask me - but what do I know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Since everything is melting, this was the last snowfall, surely,<br>maybe that means Spring will arrive early.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I was pondering Spring last night,<br>I realized, I wouldn't even mind a small bug bite. </div>
