    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I returned from the gym,<br>rested my legs a tiny bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And discovered it started snowing,<br>right after I came back home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was an inch of snow,<br>on the ground already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How did I miss this,<br>ridiculous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I already had most of my gear packed,<br>but I still had to upgrade mys shoes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I tend to use elastic shoelaces,<br>they really are flexible and don't get untied.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bought new shoes,<br>that I tested with a very thick woolen sock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My shoe is two size larger,<br>a wide 13 with non slip thread.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I came pretty close,<br>but what I needed was waterproof outdoor shoes for sport.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Waterproof just means,<br>that there is no mesh/vent for water to get in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are hard to find,<br>they also need to have a low sole as not to twist an ankle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just checked all shoes,<br>regular stores don't have the proper kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I found the socks at at hunting isle,<br>in a near by supermarket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are so thick, that you need to bring the socks with you,<br>and test your shoe finds with the sock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sock will keep you warm,<br>but also smooth out any imperfections in the shoe.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I did try sliding in the snow on purpose,<br>and I slid a for a foot or two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But slow jogging,<br>is just faster walking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And rolling the ball of the foot,<br>improves stability.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't trip running that way,<br>even on a snow covered surface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rolling the ball of the foot is kind of like,<br>manually rolling a tire across snow.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think it was about 33 degrees Fahrenheit,<br>I had three elastic shirts and a hoodie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I was overheating,<br>unzipping the hoodie a little bit on my way back didn't help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For pants I had two track pants and shorts,<br>that I managed not to put on the outside, yay!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the way, people, including <span>Superman<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>wear shorts on the outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that they can remove them if it gets too hot,<br>without removing pants first.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You know, what is Superman supposed to do,<br>in the middle of a damp battle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would have been a scandal,<br>if he had to take his leotard off first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Smartly, the man of steel,<br>puts his underwear on last.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And anyway,<br><span>Batman<sup>[2]</sup></span> does it too, and I like <span>European comics<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I waddled out of my apartment complex,<br>and started slowly jogging with my 10lb. dumbbells.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It felt great,<br>I was barely overheating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, the time I got to the intersection,<br>I noticed the snow direction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Moments later the snow was getting in my eyes,<br>it was impossible to run.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than rain,<br>snowflakes cause discomfort.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I had to stop,<br>and put my snow goggles on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe, sunglasses could work,<br>but goggles was all I had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was saving them,<br>for dangerously cold weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it makes sense to just cover the whole face,<br>the snow isn't going to pile up and melt in your eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course, I looked Sus!<br>felt like an impostor at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, this, is, Michigan,<br>it snows here - goggles are not that weird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I pulled up my ski mask over my nose,<br>and kept going, with a smile.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's when I noticed how soft the snow was,<br>running on soft snow is perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is soft when landing your foot,<br>and firm when shifting weight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Depending on snow,<br>it maybe better than running in the woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I made it half way,<br>turned around, and moved my googles up over my forehead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In retrospect, not a good idea,<br>as they fogged up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I needed them on again,<br>I would have to wipe them first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My googles double as light sunglasses,<br>so when I took them off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The milkiness of snow really hit me,<br>it looked so magical - I stopped to take a photo.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wearing my hoodie,<br>was also a mistake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the snow that landed on me,<br>melted from my warmth, and the hoodie got wet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is best to wear something,<br>that the snow won't stick to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I was very warm,<br>I felt great.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a perfect little run,<br>and it is better to run before sundown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After dark,<br>is risky.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is harder for drivers to see,<br>and they will have delayed reactions as a result.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wearing a <span>Reflective Running Vest<sup>[4]</sup></span> will help a bit,<br>but it is better to stick to running during the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, wearing your jogging clothes at home just about for 20 minutes before a run,<br>will get you started with body heat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way you don't have to wait to heat up,<br>you just start off warm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is still somewhat strange to me,<br>how jogging, prevents getting cold outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While it is still good to run in the summer,<br>it is <strong>better</strong> to run in winter, by far.</div>
