      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Superpowers</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a number of curious superpowers we all share,<br>though many may may not be fully aware of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some of the powers that we <em>are</em> aware of,<br>seem useless until put in proper context.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The following is a short list of observations,<br>that I made this afternoon upon singing a song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I attach the song at the end of this poem,<br>and that will be the first power I will share some notes on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In another poem entitled "<span>Karaoke Pokie: A Cappella Eve With The Dr. Meow Quartet<sup>[1]</sup></span>"<br>I sung an old song from a TV show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This afternoon I've noticed that a lot of the song stayed with me,<br>even though eleven months has passed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While I adjusted some thing in the song,<br>I didn't ruin it, it is more like I made it my own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only do we have a talent for nearly automatic synchronization and vocalization,<br>not only do we quickly memorize the notes of a song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we can weave our own version,<br>and by extension, begin composing and singing our own songs soon after.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>You will need a metronome during song writing<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>but the distance between customizing a song an making your own from scratch is short.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think one of the mightiest talents we have is,<br>learning a new language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes some weeks to warm up,<br>but you can understand what people are saying in under six months.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course there is a large requirement that you were probably aware of,<br>you got to move to the country where the language is spoken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stay away from classrooms,<br>go practice your portraits at the coffee shops.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nor does learning to read invoke a text book,<br>you need closed captions, and a show that captured your attention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh and that thing that adults say about teenagers learning faster,<br>is just an excuse, it is not true, you can learn a new language any time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somewhat related is the automatic poem memorization,<br>all it takes is reading it a bunch of times, and there it is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We get to carry around a poem,<br>for a few days, wherever we go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am a bit rusty but from time to time,<br>I re-memorize Red Red Rose, and Invictus.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though when I get to comfy I begin <span>yelling Invictus<sup>[3]</sup></span> in my car,<br>and use a fake Scott accent for Red Red Rose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Interestingly enough I need to power up my Scott accent before I soil it,<br>and for this I go watch one of my favorite videos <span>Three Scotts In A Ballon<sup>[4]</sup></span> - and what else could they possibly be doing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(<span>Red Red Rose<sup>[5]</sup></span> Plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a more down to earth superpower,<br>I would like to take moment here and mention Night Vision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You'd think our eyes getting used to the dark be a simple though really cool thing,<br>for me it reminds me of one of the most embarrassing times of my life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was sixth or seventh grade the first time I slept in the woods,<br>as the fire was dying and the night vision started kicking in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sigh...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I, I don't know how to say this,<br>but there was a distant dew drop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I didn't know that a dew drop can shine that bright at night,<br>I threw a bunch of sticks at my One Eyed Huge ****** Wolf.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I couldn't fight it anymore,<br>I went to sleep ready to be eaten, I guess.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a rare creature that startles him self with a fancy dew drop,<br>and I have nothing more to add to this story.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But my horrible shame brings us to one of the most beautiful and restoring powers,<br>which is walking months long trails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here in North America that means walking,<br><span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[6]</sup></span>, <span>Continental Divide Trail<sup>[7]</sup></span>, and the <span>Pacific Crest Trail<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These trails represent Mental Detoxification and easy life saving weight loss,<br>this occurs due to lifestyle change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People, work hard at building careers,<br>but they don't stop to consider if they are healthy for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Constant overwork, stress and worry, and little emphasis on health, wisdom, books and poetry,<br>are no good for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all taught that a career is a beautiful and prestigious thing,<br>but that is wrong, life is beautiful and precious, and to be completely honest all human being are Holy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Walking a months long trail, and letting our minds and bodies heal<sup>[9]</sup></span>,<br>is by far one of our most magnificent powers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This marvelous and extremely modern day and age there is something extremely technological,<br>that is closely related to walking long trails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it requires the strangest thing you will hear all day,<br>it requires that you wear a large solar powered battery on you backpack.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is an important part of walking the long trails,<br>it is listening to Narrated Books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh what a beautiful and blissful journey that six month trek becomes,<br>you get to take away not just your improved health, but also your supercharged wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think there is only one thing that can be said on the subject:<br>"Just do it Maaaan"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Having some free time is a wonderful opportunity to grab a rhyming dictionary,<br>be it a paper book or an <span>rhyming website<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The big parts of the poem always come from our heart,<br>but when transitioning between stanzas gets tricky, the rhyming dictionary is indispensable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when I do my rhymes I say what I want to say in the first part,<br>and make the second one for the rhyme.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is never an empty thing,<br>it always comes put as a supporting wisdom, but I let the rhyme decide what wisdom it will be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if the is nothing I can say of value,<br>then I search for synonyms and sometimes even re-word the first line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My most favorite, are my funny poems, like <span>The Midnight Owl<sup>[11]</sup></span>,<br>I am certain that it is humor that puts magic in poetry.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">No list of superpowers would be complete without the physical powers,<br>and the one power that is on top of my mind, is Jogging in cold weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Truly a thing to behold,<br>but you do need to dress well avoid being cold and getting too sweaty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And do spend some time bundled up at home, in your warmest clothes,<br>so that you leave for the jog already warm or toasty, and don't have to spend the first 15 minutes warming up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not overheating during exercise is like flipping the turbo switch,<br>tiredness comes much later than usual, is at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The trick to jogging and all the other exercises, including Bodybuilding,<br>is an low tech <span>Interval Timer<sup>[12]</sup></span> that will allow you to gently ramp up your activity period while eliminating your rest one second at a time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way to understand how this works, is with the idea of choking your muscles,<br>if you lift to heavy or goo too much, you will become too overwhelmed to continue your exercise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as a result,<br>you will fail to increase your endurance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Interval timer, is an automated trainer<sup>[13]</sup></span>,<br>that will prevent you from going too hard and becoming too tired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which in turn will allow you to keep digging deeper and deeper,<br>into your power of endurance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This sends a powerful message to your body to adapt,<br>and like a good horse it will do so by growing more muscle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an interesting observation, for sure,<br>going too fast or too heavy, will not allow you to go far enough to ask your body to adapt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a very interesting variation on the interval timer,<br>that is called <span>Couch To 5K<sup>[14]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the same principle as the interval timer,<br>but <span>Couch to 5K is designed for jogging<sup>[15]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These kinds of slow increase programs,<br>are an easy way towards Marathons and even Ultramarathons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My own variation is <span>Shuffle Dancing<sup>[16]</sup></span> with Dumbbells,<br>to ever faster songs, where I pay attention to the beats per minute, and dance in-sync with the beats of a song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The faster you dance the more moves you have to cut,<br>because they are either unsafe or too slow, but it absolutely increases jogging endurance without putting stress on your knees.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">By far my favorite area of fancy superpowers is Art,<br>and I left it for last.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First of all, I independently invented the Art Projector,<br>it is one of the best ideas I've ever had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you connect your laptop or cell phone to a wall projector,<br>and use effects such as posterize or find edges on your source photo, you can easily transport the outlines and proportions to canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a picture of your friend,<br>and begin painting, a wall projector completely removes the boring part of art, and has you start with colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can create large accurate graffiti,<br>or simple charcoal drawings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Using a computer will allow you to change contrast,<br>to go back and forth between outlines and colors, so that you always find your way around the features of the source photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, there is a very unusual art power,<br>that we are all aware of, but never connect it to art for some reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all had moments where we recognized a thing in a cloud formation,<br>a butterfly or a face, but rarely do we see pattern recognition as a superpower.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you see artists put a lot of rough lines on paper,<br>they are actually trying to find a cloud that comes close to what they are hoping to draw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They eventually pick lines that fit what they need best,<br>and make them thicker or erase the others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Painters do something similar,<br>they lay down paint until they see a pattern that works for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is similar to the inkblot test in a way,<br>they keep circling around what they want, until they SEE IT.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is never quite precisely what they originally imagined,<br>but it is what they need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Try creating some goofy shapes with Tea or Coffee on paper,<br>and see if something random jumps out at you, you can then outline it with a pencil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Repeat the exercise by trying to come close to what you would wish to create,<br>and keep trying and trying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And most often after three of five tries and a bit of a squint,<br>a variation of the shape you wanted will jump out at you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can also do something similar with kids' drawings,<br>let them draw squiggles until you see something that you can make out of them, and then take over, and give them credit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think many of the great painters and sculptors,<br>invited that drop randomness into their creative process, and had great fun somewhat discovering their next artwork.</div>
