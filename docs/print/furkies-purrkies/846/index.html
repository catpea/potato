  <div class="paragraph">Awash with boring topics all day long,<br>I must rise <strong>and</strong> rise <strong>and</strong> stray strong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t win every fight,<br>but I won today, alright.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">See, I started writing about writing a program,<br>already made a cool diagram.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even before I got out of bed,<br>but tell you what, that made me sad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I muttered in my best Cowboy accent “I ain’t writin’ ‘bout no programming again,<br>so sirre Bob I ain’”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, I saw this as a test,<br>and then promptly set off on a great quest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I set off in search of an interesting topic,<br>and searched all between the microscopic and telescopic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I found 47,<br>from which I picked 11.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when I finally narrowed it down to one,<br>I knew my wonderful topic quest was done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that I would write rhyme,<br>not worth a dime.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I chose to write about how mightily I fight,<br>to write right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To me programming is a lyrical flea,<br>that I must flee.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or a strange angry bear that waddles around,<br>with this fat tits out, completely bare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a fowl owl,<br>that smells foul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Really, programming is like digging a hole,<br>it will never make a poem whole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is like learning that compliment,<br>and complement are two different words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or that you just peel the peel,<br>because peal, apparently means loud sounds, yikes!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course you hear,<br>what I am saying here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Writing a good poem is like riding a horse,<br>you keep screaming until your voice is hoarse.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Lemme tell ya, I started learning the Queens tongue,<br>when I was still young.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I only learned like six words,<br>and stringing them together was like herding birds. </div>
  <div class="paragraph">I first learned about the letter T,<br>as I grew up wanting to become B. A. Baracus. Mr. T.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I started wearing many chains,<br>and begun early, to work on my gains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the first word that really got me,<br>was on a British box of tea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As I learned that it is pronounced TEA,<br>like Mr. T.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While the word was new,<br>it was something I already... knew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was like FFFFFFFFF,<br>for I already knew some simpler words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I swore on all the Mr. T chains I wore,<br>that although learning English was going to be war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would fight like a mighty boar,<br>to never become a bore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would fight,<br>like a knight in the night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To need all my words to properly kneed,<br>until they became what I really need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would peel the peel,<br>to create lyrical appeal.</div>
