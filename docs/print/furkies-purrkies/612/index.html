    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am always cheerfully up to something artistic or smart,<br>only for a train to toot the horn and ruin my little art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lived most of my life next to train tracks,<br>and the loud noise the horn makes, sucks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than train tracks, the train crossings are awful too,<br>in America they ring a constant bell to annoy you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What a wretched thing a train operator is,<br>as when the horn goes off, the fault is all his.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I always take the philosophical view,<br>always considering the crew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being started countless times by their stupid horn,<br>I view them with nothing but scorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each time I hear that frightful noise,<br>I see that pushing buttons is something that-ugly-man enjoys.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He pushes the horn button multiple times in his incompetence,<br>and I call it "horn incontinence".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I do feel bad that he works nights far away from home,<br>tooting horn to his irritable bowel syndrome.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I know his family needs a break,<br>for their own sake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, I will admit, it was my destiny to drive trains,<br>crisscrossing all the great plains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While everyone wanted to become an attorney,<br>I just wanted to go on a fancy train journey.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is great wisdom in exploration,<br>out lives should not be lived in resignation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than trains I ended up lifting weights,<br>all the way out in Unites States.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I don't want to ride trains anymore,<br>I prefer a nice and quiet bookstore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I don't want to RIDE the train,<br>I still wish to complain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially about that damn horn,<br>to which I seem to have been born.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us never forget that the train man could use the horn just one time,<br>instead he plays the song of his people - which should be a crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So next time you are stuck waiting for a train and hear the horn afar,<br><span>honk back at him from own your car<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
