      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Next Generation Of Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are selling expensive fantasies, document it and show the mothers,<br>tell them that you want to gather up the pieces to help others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that you are going to build a new school,<br>and that you need support and every available tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tell them that you will help the students to real careers,<br>that you don't want their future to be filled with fear or tears.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are not teaching because they are chained,<br>they have become bloated, corrupt and stained.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not OK to go into debt because of College,<br>education must be purely about knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An alternative path to bypass the corruption is needed,<br>and the curriculum can't be dictated it must be seeded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It must emerge and or grow organically,<br>it cannot be created by politicians mechanically.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The curriculum that is truly prudent,<br>adapts to each student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Computers must be used to help the student on their path,<br>not everyone wants to start by learning math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must also put an end to abstract tests,<br>we should let the student build a company and let them follow what it suggests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which also means that we must replace grades with monetary reward,<br>that basically puts the end to to students getting bored.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most important thing that the student should get,<br>is a real portfolio, and a way out of poverty and debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's right, real school,<br>is also a very useful tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, the students will grant a small percent of their outfit,<br>back to the school so that it may grow and split.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When there is too much money in a school,<br>it divides like a cell, which is actually pretty cool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The newly funded school can pop up half way across the world,<br>and it will teach the young and the old.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no graduation, students move on when they generate enough revenue,<br>students with companies that fail return and restart the process anew.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not really enough to just fix schools and keep going,<br>because humanity must continue growing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So at the end of this century we need schools that set children free,<br>from all the shades of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May computers, programming, pen plotters, 3D printers, desktop CNC machines and projectors,<br>help the students to make their way to all the sectors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Once there was a lovely movement called unschooling<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>where children explored on their own but that lacked the tooling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make the schools you build a highly advanced version of that,<br>where not only students get the tools, but also co-found companies they work at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You won't need state funding this way,<br>and you students will learn every day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Consider this to be the next generation or version of education,<br>this way not only you teach, but fix poverty while spreading to every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These schools must help humanity with peace, growing, and seeing,<br>and that can only be achieved by helping each student to become a great being.</div>
