    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here I will ask you to slow down where it comes to color,<br>but I also present an obvious shortcut in the end, both ways will have you learning in a jiffy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Color combinations are all around you,<br>but you need to discover and catalog them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then create your artworks in harmony,<br>with the colors that speak the most.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the horrible tragedies of school,<br>are those cheap pre-mixed paints, they speak nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They attack art,<br>they hurt it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long before you move beyond Graphite and<br>coloring with the gentle beauty of Coffee and Tea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to begin keeping a journal of colors,<br>don't make difficult mixtures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that you dot next to your color,<br>what you have mixed, so that you can re-create the colors, without guessing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you go through your day,<br>pay attention to color combinations around you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you find something interesting try capturing it in your color journal,<br>you buy a mini watercolor kit with all the classical colors and keep it near by.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, speed they slowly towards color,<br>the world of mixing color is a world of poetry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Worlds of poetry can not be hurried,<br>they have to come to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not sure which colors go where,<br>then don't paint, yet, just let the under-painting be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Note that colors are best added, slowly and in layers,<br>so that you can keep watching your art develop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Watercolors for example are a high precision instrument,<br>because you create the color semi-transparent layer by semi-transparent layer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't paint with the color you need,<br>you apply transparent layers of color until they stack up to give you the color you wanted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, there are these impossibly beautiful color combinations,<br>Purple & Orange Gold, White Pearl & Raging Red, Shining Gold & Scarlet, Green Pea & Leaf Brown, Sad Teal and Lost Pink.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when you create your portrait around those colors,<br>the colors will have their own say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will add a harmony,<br>that delivers your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are colors that make no sense,<br>they may go together, they may be the colors in your reference or subject, but they speak, nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I hate to say it,<br>but they should be avoided.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't use colors that have nothing to add to your art,<br>or have no reason to be in your art, use only those combinations that go together</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The people that know color well, are the <span>Graffiti Artists<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>3D Graphic Designers<sup>[2]</sup></span>, and <span>Computer Art Designers<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can see different artists, and unique artworks,<br>reusing the same color combinations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Precisely, because,<br>the selection of color is an art in it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before you use color in your art,<br>you have to learn to observe it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps, create a catalog of color,<br>which maybe you could share with the world - and what a beautiful poster that would make.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time you discover you are ready,<br>you won't need to think of primary colors and opposites for mixing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You'll have your own,<br>much more precise ways that make you colors glow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But is is also OK to hurry,<br>so as long as you stand on the shoulders of giants.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is my shortcut,<br>copy colors of artists that speak well with them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you know that color selection is an art,<br>and that your combinations have to be meaningful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you don't get stuck,<br>just picking whatever colors your models wore, or subjects were painted with, you'll be OK.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another way to think about it is,<br>this:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you find something you like,<br>don't pay attention to the color it has...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But instead ask, which of the precious color combinations that I love,<br>would make this portrait or painting even better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then make a dozen little miniatures and sketches,<br>and just try them out, your sketches, also become a work of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Consider framing your sketches,<br>or maybe just sketch on a large poster, that then can hang at the gallery next to your painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You search for subject and color harmony,<br>is sure to tell a beautiful story.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, once you find the harmony of subject & color,<br>then you are well on your way to a new masterpiece.</div>
