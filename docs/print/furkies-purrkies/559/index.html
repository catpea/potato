      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Biographies: Stories of Wisdom, and Adventures in Life</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I could see the people who knew High School was fake, or at least trouble,<br>all three principals knew, and the English teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The English teacher,<br>tried to pass on a message.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He didn’t care about anything but that message, the message was:<br>“<span>The choices we make dictate the life we lead, to thine own self be true.<sup>[1]</sup></span>”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The third principal put up an experimental class to try to get a read on us,<br>I was the control sample, that was the semester I dropped out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(I am not 100% sure he became a principal,<br>someone who had his last name was a principal few years ago.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is good data,<br>I hope he used it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He had another message,<br>“Wherever you go there you are.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This message means that you can’t run away, or move somewhere, or escape something,<br>that the change must come from within.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reason I ended up as the control sample, was because the news class teacher,<br>and let me just say to this day I don’t know what a news class is...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Was unstable, presumably attempting to be funny,<br>I am 95% sure he licked his finer and put it in one of the sleeping student’s ear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I needed to leave that class,<br>because it was creepy - I don’t remember what my plan was - but I was exploring the school corridors when the experimental class teacher grabbed me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The class would always open by asking the students how they really feel,<br>and the teacher said, not to say I am fine, becasue that meant f’d-up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the kids would talk about their lives,<br>the assistant psychologist would scribble things in the corner.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These were real feelings, real concerns,<br>real experiences.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there was a problem<br>with what the teachers were trying to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they were getting corrupted feedback from us,<br>as a result of the problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Sunaura Taylor<sup>[2]</sup></span> has this heartbreaking, powerful, gut wrenching, screaming, work of art,<br>that brings me to tears every time I think about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That perfectly captures, why they were getting shit data from us,<br>it is part of her “<span>Factory Farms<sup>[3]</sup></span>” set, entitled “<span>Chicken Truck<sup>[4]</sup></span>”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, we were reporting how we were doing relative to the world we knew,<br>and the world we knew in High School was pretty sad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In order to report how we were really doing in school, and in life.<br>we needed to know more about life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least... we needed to make weekly trips to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit Zoo, Michigan Science Center, Bell Isle Park, ride the People Mover,<br>we needed to be at every performance of the Michigan Opera and Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and never miss a new show at the DIA.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most important thing we needed was a plan out of poverty,<br>meaning we needed help with building our companies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In case this is somehow too new, or too unrealistic,<br>please, please, realize that, the first company the class would have co-founded together, was going to take care of getting students to visit all those places and more - we’d have lectures all around the city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead, we were just reporting how we were doing,<br>in Sunaura’s Chicken Truck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We were,<br>F.I.N.E.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">High School is our first real problem,<br>and not letting it crush us, is our first battle against invisible prison walls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can push the walls back - well enough,<br>but we can’t see what is outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We couldn't answer how we were doing,<br>anymore than a person who spent his life in a cubicle could</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think we need to be more cautious,<br>about letting other people convince us that they have all the answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we need to keep in mind,<br>that some people will not be aware they are hurting us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is probably what “road to hell is paved with good intentions” means,<br>people being tricked into thinking they are helping.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may not be safe to believe,<br>that schools are going to make the future certain for us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In military <span>the recruiter always lies<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>there will be no Charger, no Camaro, what you sometimes get is being scared of fireworks for the rest of your life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In science or medicine, even if we set aside the 400,000 yearly deaths from medical errors,<br>getting into science does nothing for Mental Health, Wisdom and Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If schools tried to help us for real,<br>co-founding businesses, constantly reading beautiful biographies would be the first and foremost.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is what we need to do,<br>set aside the stupid ideas of grades, and that diploma which is made worthless by schools forcing us to memorize like little actors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we need to focus on building companies,<br>instead of working for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can still have your medical carrier,<br>but here you will no longer be discarded when they realize that you can be replaced with two cheaper employees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can still be a scientist,<br>find your won co-founders, get investors to help you build powerful laboratories.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But above all,<br>our education needs to be Real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know,<br>you are in a chicken truck on this one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to know what a real education is,<br>but we can get past this, by reading biographies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies are something else,<br>real people, real lives, real struggles and - my goodness - real wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies only sound boring,<br>they are stories of adventure, adventure in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should absolutely,<br>start with the stories that interest you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The whole point is to become inspired,<br>and a little bit wiser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The books that people adore that seem uninteresting to you,<br>or maybe seem too hard to read, are actually things you leave for later.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some books may seem confusing the first time you listen to them,<br>but that is only because you are reaching too far, your on-ramp is too steep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, before you start reading philosophy,<br>you should read about the philosophers, and then about the work you are trying to read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or before you get to Shakespeare,<br>you should read everything about him, and then study guides, and kind of like him as a person, or persons as the case may be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Understanding life is important,<br>and it will absolutely help you see where to go next.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biographies, or Stories of Wisdom and Adventures in Life as they should be called,<br>are probably the best way to look outside of high school, outside of all the cages in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know we are all extremely intelligent, that we can learn anything,<br>and before we know it we start becoming wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is about going at your own pace,<br>and learning in a sequence that fit what you already know; that fit you best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is about thinking of new solutions, to new problems,<br>by subtle analogy to the things that you know, to the things that you have learned from wise beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then beyond Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>is Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most of the books worth reading,<br>will be written by Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Great beings are the people that change the world for better,<br>they are the true force that drives the advancement of Human Kind.</div>
