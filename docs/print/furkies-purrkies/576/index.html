      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of The Memory Cathedrals And The Tree Of Knowledge</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not overestimate the length of the road you must travel,<br>to reach the point where you are comfortable with how much you have learned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are magnificent beings,<br>and the wisdom does not come from knowledge alone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will reach tipping point between knowledge and wisdom,<br>not with knowledge alone, but with the great multiplier of subtle analogies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom,<br>is near.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Before I describe the structure of the new schools, and go over some of the problems,<br>I must issue a warning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being able to read books, is the most important lesson that early schools must teach,<br><span>growing up without the ability to read is crushing, and it is torture<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage all the students in the world to help each other,<br>and search for those who are hiding that they can’t read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First bring them Narrated Books, create a fund to help them with money,<br>and then bring them to class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the greatest Honors and Responsibilities that a student can have,<br>is making sure that everyone is able to read and has free access to narrated books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the world to books,<br>and guard and protect real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, to fix education, we begin by setting all the subject divisions aside,<br>and building what can be thought of as the new tree of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The root of the tree of knowledge honors the littlest ones,<br>who honorably never stop asking why.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We begin at the birth of the universe,<br>the leading theory of the big bang.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From there we will talk about the universe,<br>the third generation star, her accretion disk, and the coalescing of earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a lesson in astrophysics,<br>this is a lesson in when and where we are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once we get to <span>Stromatolites<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>we will start the <span>countdown<sup>[3]</sup></span> towards the <span>Modern Human<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And only once we get to Mesopotamia, will we talk about mathematics<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>and math will be introduced along the line of time, from ancient times to Sir Newton and beyond.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a survey course,<br>the initial time based layout of all the Knowledge that humanity has acquired, is just an introduction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the tree is not to be covered in any standardized way,<br>the students are introduced to moving along the line of time, but are expected to break away and visit branches of the tree that interest them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Music and Dance, Art, Computer Programming, Design, are examples of branches that the students may hop to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They aren’t quite skipping math, they are just going to be introduced to mathematics that is flavored by their curiosity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Programmatic Music Composition is an introduction to math, Generative Art and Programming is an introduction to math, Programmatic 3D modeling is an introduction to math.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The children will access - the once cut up subjects - within the context of their curiosities,<br>the teachers will be able to see where the children are in the tree, and introduce them to groups with similar curiosity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one should be introduced to any subject directly,<br>no human can learn that way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Direct introduction is fraud,<br>it is how knowledge is stolen from students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cutting up subjects and poisoning them with abstraction and timed divisions,<br>is how students are sold for paychecks and tricked into memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To the students,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education requires time and unbroken connections,<br>don’t let anybody push you into a cutup set of nothing as that is fools gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One horrible thing that we are faced with in life,<br>is people actually pushing us to cut everything up into nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Go to fake school, take a lesson, take another lesson,<br>graduate and get a job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is how fake education spreads,<br>that is not how real education works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can’t just butter a bunch of toast and eat it,<br>we have to build cathedrals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The breathtaking thing about cathedrals,<br>is that they take multiple epochs to finish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What you start as a child,<br>will be completed by The Noble Adult, that you will later become.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are a Noble and Majestic being,<br>and all the tools of Genius are yours, and most are within you already.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No child should face the corridors of a school,<br>that sells them out for a small paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They should face nothing less,<br>than the endless magnificent maze of a memory cathedrals as unique as their mind is beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is a unique path thorough a constellation of subjects,<br>that will only match the student traveling it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will adapt course to meet with any new curiosities,<br>to adapt to new contexts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The future generations are looking at us,<br>and it is not looking good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those arguments that teachers make, are null and void,<br>because the first and foremost is the student success in the life after school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education must end,<br>the pandemics are already challenging us, climate change will soon do the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reject fake education,<br>reject memorization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Travel your constellations in search of real education,<br>build your cathedrals of knowledge, build the future.</div>
