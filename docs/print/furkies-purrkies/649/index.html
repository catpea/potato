      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">No Adventure Too Silly</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All adventures big or small are real treasures,<br>and there is no such thing as a silly adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, we really have to hang on to our talents,<br>and practice from time to time to stay sharp.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This makes us really beautiful,<br>as we circle around our little marvels and inventions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The things that call to us in childhood,<br>tend to make a life long impression on us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If we like going on nature walks when five,<br>we probably appreciate camping at seventy five.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no explanation for it,<br>it is just a little star in our constellation that never gets tired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As teenagers,<br>we almost hold a perfect map of where to go in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That map is so good, that if we get lost,<br>all we need to do is dream back in time to get back on track.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">When I came to America all the TV shows seemed to talk about,<br>getting in touch with the inner child.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This only sounds weird, by remembering where we wanted to go,<br>we can use our adult wisdom to get there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Having said that, I actually listened to the TV,<br>and tried to get in touch with my inner child as a teenager.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From a broader perspective I was still a child,<br>and the experiment did not go so good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead I gout in touch with my inner animal,<br>and it turned out it is a house cat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even now I keep telling myself,<br>maybe it means I am a lion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who can tell,<br>I know I can't.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I went to college,<br>as part of my great adventure in art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was having a lot of fun,<br>I ended up spending entire evenings painting at the College.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't care about rules,<br>I knew that my study of art won't agree with anybody - but none said anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once I finished painting my Mona Lisa copies,<br>I could see that it was not a good painting to copy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I guess that times have changed,<br>maybe Mona Lisa used to take the breath away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in modern times, faces have more detail,<br>expressions are deeper and more profound.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We speak with light and not just the shadow,<br>and paintings aren't limited to emotion, they can show attitude, philosophy, dignity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A nice research corner for modern art,<br>can be found with <span>3D artists, as they seem to be the leaders of today's art<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only real lessons I found in college,<br>are the ones I took time to create.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">When college becomes too useless to learn from for lack of coherent lectures,<br>then we have to become the teachers, to ourselves, to others, whatever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The adventures that we create for ourselves,<br>always come with a solid dose of silliness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What I learned of silliness is that joy and inspiration by any other name,<br>is still joy and inspiration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And joy and inspiration is exactly what we give up,<br>when we forget to protect our adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Neither is art just about drawing,<br>nor everything else is just about the thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A brush or pencil,<br>is also a reminder to visit to countless museums.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Likewise so is actual camping,<br>much greater than it seems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is an inner self that we can lose touch with,<br>and this happens when we start following, instead of leading.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No matter how overworked, mislead, off path we end up,<br>the constellation of stars within us will wait for us to awaken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Camping can become extremely powerful medicine<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and long before the long trails we can pack a backpack and keep it by the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all to easy to become overworked or lost,<br>the trails restore our health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will remind us to always lead, and always follow a step with the next one,<br>and to slow down so that we can feel the Sunrise and Sunsets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that we make time for our thoughts and ideas,<br>which in turn will bring many a dream, and many of those are sure to come true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot ever become lost in out joys, curiosities, dreams and adventures,<br>they can only add to make us stronger, and wiser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In truth,<br>no silly thing is a silly it seems, no matter what anybody says.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never let anybody steer you away from your path,<br>because then you will have to start searching for yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And take good care of your talents, dreams, and adventures,<br>as they are part of who you are.</div>
