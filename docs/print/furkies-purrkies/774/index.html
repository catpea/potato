  <div class="paragraph">I don’t know what got into me today,<br>as I arrived home from the gym...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even before,<br>I got out of my car...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I already searched for,<br>“digital painting glowing eyes”.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I was recently looking at fantasy art,<br>and everything is glowing in their world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I made everything glow in one of my portraits,<br>it looked great...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until I asked,<br>what will the person in the painting think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I looked at the portrait,<br>and they now had glowing blue skin.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I realized, by adding all the glowing stuff,<br>it no longer looked professional.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by going back to the original,<br>I had to remove most of the glowing parts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The glowing portrait was still recognizable,<br>but it was too scary, and more importantly too odd.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if I made a portrait like that of myself,<br>it would still look weird, I would feel weird about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just a weird thing to do,<br>It was weird.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Using reference images,<br>prevented the face from becoming too distorted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It shows what a powerful guardian that is,<br>even with glowing blue skin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Using reference images protected the portrait,<br>from becoming too unrecognizable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As artists we have to be respectful,<br>of the people we paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And unless asked to do so,<br>never cross the line where you change a person skin to glowing blue.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still learned quite a lot,<br>and tested out a theory I had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That to make something glow,<br>you don’t make it brighter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But rather begin your portrait,<br>at night, in the darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A face in dark shadow,<br>is critical to making something glow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a glow is just a swipe of a strong color,<br>with a blur around it...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, a second swipe, perhaps dimmer color,<br>with a brush thrice the size but at half opacity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the rule of less is more,<br>is a good starting point.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But glowing scenes full of dancing figures,<br>especially whimsical fantasy figures, are still a beautiful thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is as big of a realm of art as bobble heads,<br>that I am so fond of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have no doubt that the same kind of enchantment that I feel for,<br>for pop surrealist bobble heads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others will feel,<br>for magically glowing scenes at night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For many people this,<br>may become a precious gateway into art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you do come across a request for painting,<br>a shadowy photo taken at night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then know, it is not a bad photo,<br>but an opportunity to venture into the realm of magic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you have the permission,<br>and the customer understands that what they will get... is their fairie self, from a magical word.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blue is cold, if you make their skin glow with blue,<br>then they will seem distant, alien, and weird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Red is warm, it is also friendly towards all the tones of skin,<br>you will make them look friendly and magical.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The background, is a different story,<br>it can be blue, but blue again, is not a warm color.</div>
