    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Step One.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I suspect it maybe difficult to <strong>just</strong> become a writer,<br>I think you must first have something important to say to the world, writing is just kind of the way you say it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Understand what Greatness is and why you need it, Greatness does not make you successful, or worthy a following,<br>greatness makes you small, it makes you cry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see yourself across time,<br>like a Hollywood movie from where you begin to where you retire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you also see your mind before your time,<br>it was nowhere in particular and it didn't suffer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You also see the eddies you created,<br>your little things that cheerfully keep going on some other timescale.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here you see Humanity's Mistakes,<br>and the mistakes that Humanity does not yet know it is making.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing here that will make you feel great,<br>that will make you tower.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness just helps you see; and slightly unravels the worlds mistakes,<br>the more grownups the less energy to propagate mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness is an adaptive force,<br>it bypasses all the negative and wraps it, it attacks it and consumes it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It then <span>burps with colorful songs<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>makes us cry with touching triumphs<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness may make you feel small,<br>but it also makes you indestructible and unforgettable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It makes it so that your Elder Self won't have any regrets,<br>that you will travel the wisest and most cheerful paths in life.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Build a proper expedition backpack,<br>piece by piece, daydream by daydream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a particularly awful Monday,<br>try to shop for a little stove that would boil your tea, and re-hydrate powdered creations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a Tuesday, where things drag,<br>see about a hammock, they pack well and help you dangle, get one with a mosquito net.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a Wednesday after another deafening meeting,<br>treat yourself to a knife, try to find a really expensive one with a thick blade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a rainy Thursday,<br>see about a sleeping mat, and a fluffy puffy bag, and try to imagine what it would be like to sleep in the woods.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a cheerful Friday,<br>get some of those freeze dried meals and cook them at home, and make sure to pick good spices to give them flavor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On a restful Saturday,<br>away from the chaos and nonsense unwind shopping for thick socks and the most expensive hiking boots that will last a decade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And on a Sunday before a crappy new meeting,<br><span>set it all up in your living room and see if you can find some nature sounds<sup>[3]</sup></span> to take a tiny nap to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You'll never stray too far,<br>the nature is just the grab of handle away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail,<br>it is all yours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will make you slow down,<br>and regain your balance, remember your childhood dreams and restore your brilliance if tarnished with overwork.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't forget your journals, bring bug spray,<br>and get some bear spray.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bear spray is great for when you feel like fantasizing about squirting,<br>the person that got you fired and sent you into the middle of woods, how dare he.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you reach the end of your first trail,<br>it won't be long before you are frolicking the next one to finish your second biography and start a new travel and adventure volume.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Keep balance in your life;<br>no more overwork.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get serious about Halloween costumes, creating the tastiest spring rolls and learning how to dance...<br>and frequently bellow in laughter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help your friends and strangers escape their jobs, and all the pointers hops through academic hoops,<br>help them to enlightenment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them to find interesting lectures,<br>and beautiful narrated books, help them to long nature walks among Cheerful Chipmunks and Silly Raccoon, and Charging Bears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them slow down in life,<br>and remind them to keep learning and rising, and building their knowledge to no end in sight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take the wisdom you love the most,<br>and share.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more precious your message,<br>the mightier your book.</div>
