    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Ǧentī̆l<sup>[1]</sup></span> <span>Dẹ̄des<sup>[2]</sup></span> comes from Middle English,<br>and means Ennobling Deeds, or Noble Great Achievements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To simplify it and put it in normal language,<br>sans ways of thinking and noble pursuits; it means Class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In High School it means not lying <span>nor participating in lies<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>not fighting, only only protecting yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it means not following others,<br>when someone brings a can of beer...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Merely using a paint mixer to creatively shake it up,<br>and setting it back in the fridge, quietly hoping that dad hangs on to the rest of his brainless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not following means walking your own path,<br>a path where little thing matter, where you are more than a <span>brick in the wall<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ennobling deeds come in all shapes and sizes,<br>they relate to you as well as others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, never allowing anyone to tell you that you are less than a brilliant genius,<br>is a noble deed, because it is tough not to allow grades, to trick you that you are not smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you fail a test or even need to repeat a class,<br>it is a Noble Being that walks unbroken, probably while listening to Science Audio Books.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A little bit later in life, you will have to do the same,<br>but on a much larger scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When overwork or misery tries to crush you, you rise and rise,<br><span>until you cross the Bridge of the Gods<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Rising all the way straight into perfect laughter<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>is the same Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de as having once rejected bad grades, and taken to your own noble paths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your Dẹ̄des add up to make you infinitely beautiful, timeless, and unbreakable,<br>they make you wise and show that you have class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, as with all things this is slightly more complicated than it seems,<br>it is not in our culture to aim young people at Wisdom, Class, and Ennobling Deeds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are people who do end up drinking that beer,<br>and carry on to spend years doing broken things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And those broken things,<br>must not break them either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rising from a path where none urged to Wisdom and Class,<br>is a Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de in it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A bully, a thief, a criminal, an alcoholic,<br>will surely carry their burden and the consequences of their actions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that will only make their back stronger,<br>as in their wisdom they guard the point of no return that they were abandoned to cross.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Overall, nothing that we have been through should crush us,<br>the road required to put things right maybe longer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And happiness of people who have been through a rough time maybe much different,<br>from those who rose to become artists - but all roads to greatness make for Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The important point to take away from this,<br>is that no one should stay down crushed in any way, not a single person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We rise, we rise,<br><span>we rise to Greatness<sup>[7]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You might have guessed that the words Gentlelady and Gentleman,<br>describe a person who has been ennobled by their Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄des, by rising towards Greatness, with "the nobleness of The Human Spirit".</div>
