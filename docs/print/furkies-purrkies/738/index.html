  <div class="paragraph">Please understand that Superpowers are... real,<br>but the real ones are a magnitude more profound than the stuff in the comics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hyperrealism or Fantasy Art is a superpower,<br>and so is selling your art, selling creations that come from your heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching! Hyperrealism and Stylization,<br>is extremely powerful as it helps people out of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Elements of stylization such as glowing eye techniques, or face highlights,<br>or playing with camera focus are perfectly awesome superpowers as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the case is with highlights of the cheek, nose and lip, possibly forehead,<br>Hyperrealism is more than just realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hyperealism unlike a mere photo,<br>captures the way the image is processed by our minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as you progress beyond the wonders of Hyperrealism,<br>you will be stepping into a world of uncharted superpowers.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You will actually need a real and fancy journal,<br>so that you can write things down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be hundreds of things here,<br>not just glowing eye styles but notes on times of day, and backgrounds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To make eyes glow brighter for example,<br>you don't use a brighter color, nuh uh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You put your character in the middle of dark woods,<br>among cheerful fireflies and maybe a patch of foxfire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What better way to show a bright light,<br>than to make it shine at night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to capture a sunset,<br>goodness - you don't put a sun in your painting...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You highlight the ear<br>so that it glows red, as if lit by a bright sun</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hundreds, and hundreds of things,<br>and not so much about the stricture of the head for example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, just, where the most meaningful shadows and highlights go,<br>that make portraits come to life...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And not just in your hands,<br>your journal stands for more...</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Can you imagine it?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a deep and dark December,<br>your defiant heals are clicking on cold concrete.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Might as well trade your biggest purse for a backpack,<br>you brought a bunch of tablets with you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You feel footsteps behind you, you try to ignore it,<br>so you keep it cool and ponder the backup tablets you brought just in case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But eventually,<br>you just have to look.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is the cheery eyed lady with the sweet accent,<br>that always shows up first in class and never says anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But she hears your every word,<br>with awe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her nose is red,<br>and that totally just made half your lecture about noses.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And she has her tablet under her arm,<br>you smile, she smiles, the universe smiles, and the future of the human kind if brighter for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are on a mission,<br>as far as you can tell School/craft won't call you back next semester.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you set your mind on getting theses kids,<br>from zero to hero every lecture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it may not be clear to you,<br>but your two first lectures left them freaking the heck out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Orientation is supposed to go slow mo,<br>but you showed up few hours early and set-up Krita and all the tablets ... which cost you $1,100 dollars -- but f**k it, cause your class is a work of art too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And all of them did setup with art sellers,<br>and some art <strong>was</strong> bought, mostly parents, but it <strong>absolutley</strong> counts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your third lecture,<br>will show every one of your students through and through, that they don't have to be scared of poverty anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can see the road,<br>unbeknownst to you - the young lady behind you is about to make a sale during your lecture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone will just pause,<br>they will look at your rosy smiling face, and the portrait that was sold, and the young lady squeaking with delight, and back to the smiling you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On your fourth lecture,<br>you will read out a note from the customer, that they had the portrait printed on a canvas and that they love it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of your twelve lectures,<br>make the kids speechless, as you armed each of your meetings with real results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you are constantly interrupted,<br>by squeaks of new sales.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The two girls in middle row that were talking on the first lecture,<br>until they saw how easy portraits are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They actually end up teaching digital art at Peace Corps,<br>and later on, end up with a huge fashion design studio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only will they never forget you,<br>but they too become teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Certainly for their friends,<br>but also, one teaches at UofM, and another started her own art school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cheery young lady,<br>ends up working at the UN...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And nothing she does, is without that start-and-end punch,<br>that you taught her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'll talk about you for decades,<br>"Not only did she make each lecture meaningful, but she showed us we were not poor."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Friedrich Nietzsche caught on the importance of art,<br>"Art is the proper task of life." - Mindful and meaningful life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art was never about the works, ever,<br>it was always about harnessing the power to change the world - about building bridges to greater places.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you taught your students a way out of poverty,<br>and they took that beyond anything that you could have grasped,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You changed their world,<br>and in return they changed the world in a way that kept all, away from the terrors of poverty.</div>
