      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">You Are A Brilliant Genius</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must not let the world convince you,<br>that you are not a Brilliant Genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact, the definition of Brilliance and Genius,<br>is hinged upon you not letting anyone to take either from you.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you need a bit oh help,<br>Einstein wasn't smarter, and neither was Hawking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They loved being thought about that way,<br>because it made them, celebrities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they were just like you,<br>except that they did not let anything crush them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Einstein by subtle analogy<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>used trains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Hawking by subtle analogy<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>used the clock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And unlike you<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>both of them were limited by paper math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can use computers,<br>that will do the math for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you just simulate <span>SETI<sup>[4]</sup></span> with pixels,<br>to for example figure out what the <span>Drake Equation<sup>[5]</sup></span> and <span>Fermi Paradox<sup>[6]</sup></span> is actually saying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And perhaps visualize the <span>Twin Paradox<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>on an <span>ark accelerating at a reasonable although constant rate<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will brush up again dozens,<br>of <span>unsolved mysteries<sup>[9]</sup></span>, that you can have your computer solve for you.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Without any additional tools,<br>you have mastered your native language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stories, Poems, Sentences, Words, Letters, and Punctuation,<br>is not something that you are born with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are such a powerful Genius,<br>that you master it all without thinking about it too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But notice that you are surrounded by language,<br>surrounded by closed captions, books, and various other text.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are surrounded by people voicing words,<br>people creating new sentences.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is exactly why you need a simple programming language,<br>to study physics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to build a pixel star ship, or ark,<br>and spin it around singularities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Oh an by the way, don't worry about mathematical formulas,<br>it is an old language meant for paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real mathematics,<br>is <span>translated to a simple programming language<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Programming languages are just tools,<br>like with tools, you only learn them when you have a use for them.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A <span>Beat Sequencer<sup>[11]</sup></span> is a tiny example of a language,<br>there is this loop that goes in circles that triggers events.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just a grid where columns light up every beat,<br>and if there is something in a column that is lit, it plays.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a visual programming a language,<br>and <span>I invite you to explore a more complex Visual Programming language by looking at Nodes in Blender<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender will help you see <span>UNIX Pipes<sup>[13]</sup></span>,<br>and later <span>then you can install Termux on your Phone<sup>[14]</sup></span> and use <span>Bash<sup>[15]</sup></span> and <span>Node Streams<sup>[16]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Learning programming is easy as long as you set meaningful goals,<br>rather than just saving a file build a super tiny WikiWiki.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You'll explore writing to files,<br>when save is pressed on the edit page.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All computers have a silly private internet address,<br>called the localhost with the IP 127.0.0.1.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When building an HTTP server you have to give it a port,<br>such as 8080.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by going to localhost at port 8080,<br>you will see your server output.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often Hello World at first,<br>but when a request is made to your server it includes the file path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So is someone requests /main you print the home page,<br>if someone goes to main/edit you expose contents of main in a text area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A tiny little wiki,<br>is a magical teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can <span>use express.js for your experiments<sup>[17]</sup></span>,<br>it has plenty of snippets to copy, <span>and many express.js tutorial videos to watch<sup>[18]</sup></span></div>

  <div class="paragraph">Please,<br>don't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not a Brilliant Genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers are doing that,<br>because they want to hide they don't know how to teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They hide behind tests, and finals they rush,<br>and behind the ever changing flow of students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must learn on your own,<br>you must accept the responsibility for your own education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a beautiful adventure.<br>there is a million directions to pick from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can pause curiosities you conquered for years,<br>and you always get learn at your own pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you can change whatever it is you are curious about,<br>anytime you want.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are your own best teacher,<br>and school is the worst.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see?<br>you <strong>are</strong> a Brilliant Genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You've been a Brilliant Genius,<br>all along.</div>
