      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Observations Along A Road To Personalized Educational Paths That Produce Real Results And Beyond</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing good to say about the existing system of education,<br>it makes students poor and it makes them feel average and unintelligent... and can at best lead to a crappy office job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The concept of Balanced Education is a Lie, it is a fraudulent invention,<br>crafted to rob students of their savings or put them in debt, while obscuring the truth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is that a standardized curriculum cannot work,<br>and lectures in college are too impersonal to benefit the students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not that hard to graduate from college and instead of celebrating, admit the truth,<br>the predatory prices, and billing, the debt, the utter nonsense of an education, and just say:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have learned nothing that has any real impact on my life.",<br>by peddling life insurance the day you graduated you are only helping the fraud, and stealing from the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is something else that I've never heard anyone mention before,<br>school is slow, the entire system of things is slowing the students down to drain them of both savings and natural curiosity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all remember taking a class that we were fascinated with,<br>only to be presented with irrelevant off-topic subjects, at an extremely slow pace, suspiciously slow pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In other classes, the subjects are not divided correctly, things are out of sequence,<br>The best way to learn math is to start with P5.js - with programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While OOP is neat, teaching Java was a terrible idea, the language has to be free,<br>otherwise students will be forced to pay for their programs, and what an insult to their creativity that is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no an open reference implementation is not enough, to parade as a solution to greed,<br>the entire ecosystem must be Open Source, that should be a pre-requisite for a language taught in schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is already bad enough that schools are charging for lectures, and that teachers are forcing students to buy self published loose-leaf trash,<br>that they artificially alter each year to prevent used book sales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greed, money, has no room in institutions that claim to educate,<br>to take a single dollar from a students should be reason enough for the institution to permanently lose accreditation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lectures themselves are inadequate, even something as nice as CS50 from Harvard is not enough - nowhere nearly enough,<br>because it is not able to help students in Nepal, Burundi, Peru, Cambodia, or Thailand, for the simple reason that it is only in English.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially with today's technologies lectures should be given in all the languages,<br>it is not that difficult to invite Nepali, Kirundi, Spanish, Khmer, Thai speaking teachers - and it certainly: is a Great Honor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real lecture is a work of art worthy of translation into 15+ languages,<br>it is free to students, and it cost a lot of money for a college to purchase the rights to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why are we tolerating a system of education that pushes subjects years away from Students,<br>some students may wish to learn programming in 4th grade, not in College or University.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How small minded, of us, how small minded - we are one family,<br>and we are creating divisions and seeing them as achievements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real lecture is timeless, universal, accessible, open, and free - like knowledge,<br>how can we charge for something meant to be a Piece of Love for all the Students of the world?</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If your lecture does not inspire teachers around the world to translate it in many languages,<br>then it is not a lecture yet, it is not good enough yet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lectures on the subject of computer science and the art of programming are especially important to translate into other languages,<br>as they introduce students to English terms, learning a common language is extremely important for the Human Family</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe the full truth truth is, we don't have schools, our Civilization is still too primitive to build them,<br>to add to the injustice of this age: a real school is yet to be built.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is 2020 and the adults of today, wouldn't vote for Universal Basic Income for the next generation,<br>even tough they have negatively impacted it, with pollution, climate, war and nuclear weapons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps it is out of jealousy,<br>that infantile idea that if <strong>they</strong> had to work hard, <strong>the kids</strong> will have to do it too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is different when we hear such an accusation at home,<br>and when we go into a voting booth to cast our votes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What seems ludicrous when we raise our eyebrows on a couch,<br>still becomes reality when we cast our vote.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And no it is not about the economy,<br>because people don't fully understand how it works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Economy is not meant to be left to it self randomly meandering to keep rich rich and poor poor,<br>the economy is meant to be finely crafted by Great Minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With each failure, they will, fix, learn, and try again,<br>temporary failure and great change is the price to pay for trapping the world within the concept of money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not that we will do something that will ruin the way money works,<br>is that we halve already ruined things by choking the world with poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The use of money without the protection of Universal Income,<br>is a sick idea - for all the suffering that it causes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The suffering at the borders where you are unwilling to look,<br>is an order of magnitude higher than homelessness and starvation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the children were anything like older generations, they would cancel your retirement, you know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that you had to work every day for the rest of your life<br>if children have to do it, then you have to do it too - but they are BETTER then you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to word this text in a way that is not a complaint,<br>and I somewhat apologize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But because of the gravity of suffering in the places that we are unwilling to look,<br>we can't be silent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are propagating very grave mistakes,<br>the future historians will examine our behavior at great length.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially now,<br>where even the most private messages will be available to future historians.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every day you have a choice to rise up, look in the mirror,<br>and admit that the emperor is naked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each day of your life can become a beginning,<br>where you finally say "That's enough".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And learn,<br>and contribute small meaningful changes to the future generations:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Restore their dignity,<br>with Universal Income where they can afford to live away from wage slavery, and choose a life of real education without a fear of going hungry or homeless, or being manipulated or frightened.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Restore their privacy,<br>where technology used to communicate between family is not used to create profiles that sell their thoughts for profit, violate the Basic Human Right To Privacy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Restore their health,<br>by ending the use of toxic chemicals and whatever is polluting and hurting Us, Animals, and Earth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every one of us has a responsibility to Enhance And Protect Human Rights,<br>to make lasting contributions that help the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That nobody can afford to take time off from work,<br>does not mean that we should propagate this stupid system poverty to the next generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make your stand, use your wisdom and greatness,<br>stop the mistakes that plague <strong>us</strong> from reaching the future - vote to make the world a better place for the little ones.</div>
