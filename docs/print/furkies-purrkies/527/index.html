  <div class="paragraph">The most powerful things,<br>are often attacked with shame.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning astrophysics on your own, versus going to a fancy university<br>are two very different things, and guess which one you are going to be shamed for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's right people are going to laugh at you for learning on your own,<br>the teacher is probably going to laugh at you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How are you going to learn without grades,<br>without instruction, and who is going to hire you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They aren't asking you questions, and they aren't making fun of you,<br>they are attempting to manipulate you to be like they are...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because your independence, is an enormous threat to their fantasy of education,<br>they are of course aware of their own pretending-to-learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what is holding it all together,<br>is their hope that it will all come together in the last semester.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when the final semester comes around,<br>they will just be focused on moving on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The whole thing, to a starling degree,<br>is make believe.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think people always bring up Doctors,<br>and medical students at this point.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they may not know that,<br><span>medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in America<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Between 250,000 and 440,000 people die from medical errors,<br>each year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Medical professionals have the same problem,<br>as all the other students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to pass the tests by cramming,<br>but that does not mean a person is educated for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If that was the case, then nobody would have a problem with retaking all the tests,<br>that led to their graduation, that today, serves as the proof of their knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who would you trust more the self taught professional who studied in as far as that is possible, every step of the way,<br>with great love and dignity, and then went to med school, after they already mastered most things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or the students that passed the tests,<br>by memorizing everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me repeat that question,<br>who is better?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The self taught who has learned for real, out of passion, out of wishing to become a great being,<br>out of wanting to make a difference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or the kind of a person that is easily swayed by simple things,<br>and gets good at taking tests, and probably a lot of other inauthentic things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you say I will learn on my own people will laugh at you,<br>because they are terrified, because they know that can't do that, all they can do is pass the tests.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you ever do take to astrophysics,<br><span>you are likely to take a long detour into Astrophotography<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is neither a search for supernovae nor a study of anything in particular,<br>the school will call this Extracurricular Activity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are so far detached, that to them the whole point of it,<br>the love of the universe will be silly, amateur, and Extracurricular.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This happens everywhere, Learning From Science Popularizes,<br>which is an expression for love of knowledge and sharing science, is seen as trivial and a waste of time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tracing In Art, which is a way to perfectly love beauty,<br>is seen as cheating, will get you dismissed, maybe thrown out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Proportional Dividers In Sculpture,<br>will have people calling you a fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">3D Model modification in 3D modeling,<br>instead of sitting there with calipers, will be seen as copying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sampling In Music, or Hip Hop,<br>is seen as stealing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School is just a narrow channel,<br>it is not capable of teaching you integrated knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect in a lot of schools, even the Dean's is just a way to keep you taking classes,<br>because that 4.0 looks really good in their paperwork and yearly statistics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember my first time in College,<br>I asked why do I need all these other classes, when I am trying to expand my Programming knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her response was instant,<br>"Balanced Education", it was rehearsed, it was policy, it is a lie, and for them it is all about everyone keeping their jobs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in reality, schools should be about real education,<br>not just debt, hard work, memorization, stress and more debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education, to put it simply,<br>is about learning new things that integrate with your existing knowledge, and thus make it better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning new things that integrate with your existing knowledge - is how self education works,<br>and that is why it should always come first.</div>
