      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The More That All Are Looking For</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It begins within,<br>and it leads outside of the culture you are born into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is an ever evolving universal culture,<br>but any question of border.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will only ever lead the world back,<br>and the world is meant to advance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least,<br>so that it does not continue repeating its mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no preacher out there that has the answers,<br>nor will a philosopher ever have the time to answer all your questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to answer them,<br>you have to become the great being you once wished to speak to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has always been you,<br>and the road has always been the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been paved with the most powerful books,<br>written by the Humans that have risen to the greatest heights they could reach. </div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we each have different constellation of curiosities,<br>our paths will be unique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why standardized schools are such an insult,<br>to who we are meant to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why real schools are yet to be built,<br>and it is in part why the world needs you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because if all you ever do,<br>is agree, so that you don’t get yelled at anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the only ones who will advance,<br>are going to be the liars and the bullies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the good,<br>will lose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There isn't a past,<br>or a great mind that held or holds a plan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are the best hope there has eve been,<br>by virtue of your youth, the clarity of your mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And because you are,<br>new to all this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because there is hope,<br>that you will <span>go around the indoctrination<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you will rise,<br>unrestrained.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It has only ever been the Philosophers,<br>who held the answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The daughters of philosophy,<br>the sciences, can only make tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The daughters,<br><span>will not teach how to use them<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">One of the highest questions,<br>that has been posed recently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is, would you relive your life,<br>infinite number of times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the answer is no,<br>then it is the same as choosing an end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is,<br>very wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What is more,<br>we cannot push others, to choose an end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are the choices you are making helping you,<br>or are they hurting you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If an end is what you wish for,<br>then you have chosen your path unwisely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often that means that you are choosing from within the culture,<br>you have been born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often cultures trap people,<br>to make them obedient, more useful, to propagate some safe fantasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often for a a little bit of going,<br>from a lot of people.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have a flaw in our mind,<br>a terrible knot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the thing,<br>that makes a person stay in a <span>cult<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is because,<br>we can’t make decisions based on things we don’t know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is why I speak of books,<br>from which you can inherit wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Become a philosopher,<br>who rises to no end in sight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an important part of growing up,<br>growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that,<br>when all those around you start growing all the way up too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the world will become a safer place,<br>a wiser place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then we will take to building the schools we need,<br>to making money work for us, not against us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally to putting this idea of world destroying weapons,<br>and that war is somehow a thing we do... behind us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The politicians you have heard speaking,<br>will retire soon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what they have always told you,<br>and how you have been treated, it has always been about you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are the hope,<br>and you are the dream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just need to become a Philosopher,<br>so that you will know where to go next, from within, and not by being told what to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don’t let school slow you down,<br><span>start in the beginning<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
