      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The New School; Or, Building The First Imperfect School That Is Worthy Of All The Future Generations</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What if <span>the new school format is right in front of us<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>we don't need tests that are secure and vicious, because we are not forcing anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are simply creating a new school full of knowledge,<br>guidance on the left pane, the machine that must be manipulated in the right pane.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And all the way down on the bottom of all instructions,<br>a next button disabled until the machine is correctly manipulated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no need for security, enabling that button by force,<br>would prevent the student from progressing in the panes that follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And listen to this, the student is not timed, there is no graduation,<br>there are no grades, there is no punishment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students are encouraged to gather at libraries,<br>where they can be treated with respect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some of the tutorials will result in products that can make money,<br>it can be as simple as building a new website theme.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where the student would pay attention to color, clip art,<br>documentation, new components, white-space and integrity of the design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or as challenging as creating new phone applications,<br>that do useful and interesting things while protecting privacy for example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no graduation, there is no diploma,<br>but there is a path they have traveled through this tree of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not necessarily true that longest or most branching paths are best,<br>student activity it self is a good indicator of health and success.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want students to be paid for grades,<br>and to be paid for each hour of instruction about five times the minimum wage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think that is something Humanity will be ready for in,<br>900 years - today Humanity is too far behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Until then, we have to help the students to learn,<br>how to create products for sale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That will be the reward that this school offers,<br>not only do they sell a products while taking these courses.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they of course gain the ability,<br>to create non-tutorialized products.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The question here is how unique are these products,<br>they are perfectly unique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The school marketplace has a posting board,<br>where customers can request program components.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The component breakdown ensures that the poster,<br>defines a well thought out request.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine that they can post a bounty between $100 and $1,000 dollars,<br>here they will want their component to fit that budget.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will also be tasked with creating a unit test,<br>that tests if their component works as requested.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now imagine that eleven students apply to fulfill that request,<br>as part of their education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the due date is reached,<br>the test will reject those entries that fail the test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students can see the failing tests as they program,<br>so for a well defined request it will be rare to fail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lets assume all eleven students pass the automated unit test,<br>now the original poster will have to pick the best work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All eleven students receive the experience, the education, and portfolio entry,<br>but the one winner gets the big monetary payout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will take home, $900.00 dollars 90% percent of what the poster will pay,<br>the other 10% percent goes to the other students as a symbolic reward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There maybe a reasonable fee for making that post,<br>which will go to the school it self, but the school is an Open Company that publishes where the money goes, and where all the other money comes from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They each receive $10 dollars, and proceeded to make fun of the whole ordeal,<br>and greatly though in good spirits complain; how terribly unfair this school is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is always that one student that is not happy her work didn't win,<br>and I agree that it is extremely <em>-------------</em> unfair, and that she should be enraged.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now what you don't realize, is that this imaginary young lady,<br>holds the keys to the upgraded version of this school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her magnificent rage will not go to waste,<br>she will make it better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All we need to do, is to build this first imperfect and unfair version,<br>and she'll take it from there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The question that we are left here with,<br>can students learn mathematics, physics, chemistry and art from this school?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the answer is yes,<br>so as long as the right hand pane is a powerful interactive application.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the creators of these applications,<br>will be other students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think these applications represent contributions to humanity,<br>as great as landing a human on the moon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their names will be proudly,<br>attached to the applications they help to create and update.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will close with an example of learning about music this way,<br>they are almost perfect examples of what this school would feel like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first and richest of the two is <span>Learning Music at Ableton<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and the second more technical is <span>Learning Synths, also at Ableton<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>3Blue1Brown<sup>[4]</sup></span> Educational Chanel shows the power of visualization,<br>in regard to mathematics, however there is a subtle problem here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because approaching mathematics with the standard language pf mathematics,<br>creates an extra translation step, at least at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Initially <span>mathematical notation must be converted to a programming language<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>where it is much more useful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will grant the students <span>the power to create interactive visualizations<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>on par with 3Blue1Brown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An advanced class, will present the students with <span>Blender Tutorials<sup>[7]</sup></span> here,<br>they will be able to upload their geometry and sell it in the school marketplace.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think the most valuable asset for sale are tutorial videos,<br>and live support, or tutoring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is enough here to help students out of poverty,<br>may this school be always be open, and always free.</div>
