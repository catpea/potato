      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of Denial Of Education, And The Problem Of Sequence</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A sequence problem, as I termed it,<br>is when one thing prevents another.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I find that people with good intentions,<br>often take to repairing problems in the wrong place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was little I struggled with understanding my bullies,<br>and later I just couldn't imagine why criminals do the things they do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But eventually I understood that the word criminal is wrong,<br>these are just people so stressed and pressed, that life becomes about do or die.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, I always mention at this point, that criminals are extremely dangerous,<br>because of the state their mind has been twisted into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A really good example is a soldier, they must kill, or they will be killed,<br>they are a good person at home, but the circumstances of war make a mindless killer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I repeat, a person who is in a warped state,<br>is extremely dangerous, do not hope for their goodness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take years, not months; for them to heal, and for their goodness to return,<br>that is how our minds are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are natural born fighters and warriors,<br>this was necessary for our survival and protection of our tribes, clans, and kingdoms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To correctly approach the impossible problem of crime,<br>we first must learn how to protect people and prevent the crushing stress, that leads to crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And once a person shows that they entered the state of a criminal,<br>they can’t be punished with prison, because prison only makes people worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prison may cement the state they have been put in,<br>and they may never be able to return to the person that they really are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Think of it as Forever War,<br>no return, just war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A person who entered a life of crime needs medical, psychiatric, psychological help,<br>they need many years of therapy, and understanding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By sending criminals to prison, we are attempting to fix a problem,<br>at the wrong place, and as often the case is, we make it worse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now let me show you what happens on the others side,<br>on the side of the innocent and beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because in some places, the problem of sequence, is not an error,<br>but it is purposefully crafted to force obedience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In more than one place around the world,<br>women are denied an education, which prevents them from becoming an independent thinker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because they are tricked out of education as children,<br>they will not have time to return to it as an adult.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Such nations claim that they make the rules,<br>and it is not out problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a nation may only own its geography,<br>it cannot own a mind - because that is called slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Denial of education is how slave uprising are prevented from occurring,<br>the old saying goes, an educated slave is a no good slave.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The solution to open our borders,<br>and grant these women a home, a real education and universal income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that they don’t have to work, many of them will plan to return,<br>and real education demands that they have all the time and adventure they need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By not helping these girls and women out of slavery,<br>whatever else we do, is not nearly enough or somewhere in the wrong sequence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here, I want to describe an induced problem that is most familiar to us all,<br><strong>fake</strong> education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are not providing students with real education,<br>as that requires that each student is treated as a unique individual.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And those in charge of education are too uneducated, and too greedy,<br>to see how that can be easily accomplished with a cheap smartphone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By presenting students with fake education, we push them into adulthood,<br>with ideas like “getting laid makes a man”, or “weed is just an herb”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As a result they will make the same choices and mistakes,<br>that <strong>everyone</strong> is always making.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This incredible threat of being held back, or punished with a bad GPA, or bad grade,<br>unless a ravenous mind is obedient, is sick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The threat of never being able to get a job, because of bad grades,<br>in a shitty and fake school, makes adults look like total morons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education enables young people to launch startups and invent new technologies,<br>from art and software to 3d printing and manufacturing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is what sets children free from poverty,<br>fake or standardized education is what presses them into poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are such powerful thinkers, such unbreakable beings,<br>who neither fear torture nor certain death.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the only way to control us, and to keep us weak,<br>is to prevent us from learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it by sick arrogance in modern nations,<br>or deliberate attack in nations ruled by ghouls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Understand that the words Real Education,<br>are sacred, and anything short of it is a disgrace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that the future will not arrive as a function of time,<br>but as a function of real education and life long wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every human being is meant for Greatness,<br>and their Greatness is necessary to make this world a better place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anytime that greatness is dimmed or temporally extinguished,<br>out entire world becomes proportionally darker; we all lose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, I ask that those of you who have the passion needed,<br>to upgrade the <span>Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>[1]</sup></span> to rise to the challenge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please, ensure to safely, grant all human beings the full measure of real education at no cost,<br>and to aim to end poverty with an International Bank of Universal Income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to remind all Humans, that meaning is found in Greatness Of Heart and Spirit<br>as they venture towards becoming Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that to grow up, means to grow all they way up,<br>until we each become a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ask you to begin rebuilding the world immediately, and without any delay,<br>you don’t have to wait until your shift is over, just drop it and go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And make your life about of Great Adventure,<br>so that there is always room, even for the greatest of your thoughts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Refine it, expand it, enhance it, reinforce it, let it make you wise and powerful,<br>and then make it so that every Nation stands behind it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make it so that no Human Being,<br>is ever denied real education.</div>
