      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Right To Greatness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world is not ending,<br>it is just not where it should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while you are correct to think that most people won't care until it is too late,<br>understand that this is because the world has wronged them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are hurt with overwork, fear confusion, poverty, including poverty in their mind,<br>the idea of paid education can't be more twisted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once an institution charges for knowledge,<br>it becomes permanently tarnished, for putting obstacles in Humanity's way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is not even considering the question of whether or not school can actually teach,<br>cramming, memorizing, passing, graduating, maybe giving a speech.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A speech which cannot help but to praise the institution in question, and the faculty,<br>the valedictorian can't say anything negative, and still hope to pay off the debt that school put them in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all too easy to pick an achiever,<br>that feels warmly about their education, but this is a matter of all the graduates displaying more then they could accomplish on their own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this concept of a GPA, that is controlled by the teachers and school,<br>upon which their funding, and prestige depends on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If there actually ever was a need for a real graduation,<br>then it would have the <strong>students</strong> present the fruits of their education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things that they have created, or lead, or begun,<br>meaningful, long lasting or permanent things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Anyway, you can spot the lie, by just considering whether or education has an end,<br>real education does not last four years, it lasts a lifetime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The silent unspoken truths are all too simple, a name brand education gets people accepted into world renowned circles,<br>it is never about the education, it is about the doors that the brand names open.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you see, education can't be faked, education is the driving force beneath Greatness,<br>it empowers with knowledge, enlightens with Wisdom, and lists the person up to Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In greatness we don't wage wars, we don't steal blue skies from children a world over by flying drones over their heads,<br>In wisdom, in greatness, we ensure a real education decades before the poverty takes hold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are brothers and sisters,<br>we can see into the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That the world is the way it is, today,<br>is proof that representatives are a cheap and feeble tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With real education, in wisdom, knowing the next steps would be beautiful,<br>it would fill all with Hope.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in what we have today,<br>people throw themselves into overwork out of desperation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They never discover that are meant to become Great Beings,<br>that money is meant to help humanity grow not force it into wage slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wiser generations that are yet to come,<br>will be able to declare whether or not schools in our era held us back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few hundred years from now our internet and even private emails will be read in search for answers,<br>they will search for the answer to the question of why?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why didn't we repair all the social constructs that are of our own making and invention, and yet hold us back,<br>why didn't we help humanity advance sooner than later.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How could we allow poverty to swallow the whole world,<br>and how could we not see, how wrong we were.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This damage poverty causes to a person cannot always be undone,<br>however, it can be prevented in future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Socrates tried to so this,<br>he tried to teach Wisdom to alter the course hos Civilization was on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He tried to make the future better,<br>the only wise way there is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By teaching the younger generation,<br>to prevent the repetition of mistakes, propagation of errors, and all the things that don't belong in wise decision making.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose to become a Great Being,<br>even those who have been hurt by the world, will listen to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all have a predisposition to listen to Great Beings,<br>not only will the younger generations become wiser because of who you have become, but you will also be able to restore hope in those who lost it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom will make the world stop and listen,<br>the very definition of wisdom is that it is integrated, and easy to understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though yours it maybe as vast as space,<br>it will forever remain Human, Forever, All Too Human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom can be as simple as <span>helping people out of invisible prisons<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>a lot of the things that are crushing humanity are concepts that we invented and can regain control over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But humanity can't be torn by noise, confusion, religions, politics, borders, hunger, pain,<br>it has to begin growing towards wisdom, where it can converge, integrate, unite, combine its countless strengths.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The worlds needs Wise and Unstoppable beings,<br>to remind its people of the importance of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you become a Great Being, the world will begin learning from you,<br>people will follow in similar footsteps, both the young and the old, both the angry and the cheerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't just lead them, help them to become like you,<br>that is all that the universe will ever ask from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the end all it will take, is for the younger generations to understand,<br>that becoming Great Beings is their right.</div>
