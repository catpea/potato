    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Well, 3D modeling turned out to be magical,<br>but it requires a 3D printer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not good to just learn 3D modeling,<br>without anything to take to a printer in the evening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite internet tutorial video is:<br>“<span>MODELLING For Absolute Beginners | Blender Human Tutorial<sup>[1]</sup></span>”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a 30 minute tutorial that shows how 3D artists think,<br>and how they operate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is so easy,<br>I stopped writing down the shortcuts, and just started shaking my head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Seeing the progression of Cutting, Extruding, Scaling, and Beveling,<br>and the power of Mirroring, and see a little human sculpted out of a cube...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Shows the workflow,<br>for everything else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I created a new wallet, <span>The Saturn 1.0<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>with things pointing upwards for a change, and it looks great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have been creating new wallet designs almost every day,<br>it has been a fantastic experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I even identifies the main ways,<br>to connect wallet face plates together:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Side teeth that can hold para-cord, or even hairbands,<br>that also create a proper pocket with zero chance of anything falling out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Elongated holes for elastic bands, about inch in width,<br>here the elastic is fed in up and down until it locks in, much like a book bag strap.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A t-shaped protrusion, often inset, that accepts o-rings, basically rubber washers,<br>this creates fantastic looking hinges, that look nothing like rubber washers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A single elongated hole, on one face plate and an elongated protrusion at a small angle, on the other, to create a latch, for o rings, or even standard paracord.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course plain holes for string, elastic shoelace, or para-cord,<br>the string is looped up and down to keep the plates together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think with just a tiny bit more practice I can begin modeling,<br>a variety of hinges, and locking mechanisms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this point I will be able to add my second project,<br>which is miniature computer cases for the Raspberry PI, including the tiny Zero model.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">When I started learning modeling,<br>the single most important thing for me was perfect precision.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender allows that, by presenting a confirmation box for every action,<br>where once can change values.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now, especially with the mirroring feature, which takes care of the sides of my wallets,<br>I no longer pay that much attention to dimensions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than mathematical perfection,<br>I just make sure that things look interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I still sometimes adjust dimensions,<br>just now I indented a side of a para-cord guide by .5 millimeters so that it does not slide off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing that requires perfect dimensions,<br>is a credit card/id template so that I know everything fits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with mathematics, learning mathematics for mathematics's sake,<br>is very difficult.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning 3D modeling, just to be able to make a little human as in the tutorial I mention,<br>this is not easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if you get a 3D printer,<br>Ender 3, version 2, and a $30 roll of white PLA - then everything changes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because at that point,<br>you are no longer learning modeling, or how to use a program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You become a Product Designer,<br>it can be wallets, but there is nothing wrong with printing small sculptures, or organic looking products, or jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jewelry is going to be my third project,<br>an Ender printer can’t print very small things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it can print enlarged models,<br>during prototyping.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bronze/silver/gold properly sized versions have to be ordered via <span>Shapeways<sup>[3]</sup></span> or similar<br>but, they only get printed when someone actually makes a purchase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are printed on demand,<br>when a sale is made and in case of Shapeways this can be done through their online store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there are several methods that can be used in jewelery making,<br>you can search the internet for “<span>3d printed jewelery tutorial<sup>[4]</sup></span>”</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I just want to say, if you need proof that you really are a genius,<br>just watch the 3D modeling tutorial.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School grades are only meant for state testing and getting funding,<br>we are all equally intelligent, all you have to do is find a hobby that interests you...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And call it, self education,<br>learn at your of pace, in your own sequence, and and have fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Integrated self paced education, that produces real results,<br>it is the best kind of education.</div>
