  <div class="paragraph">The question of High School vs. One Thousand Narrated Books,<br>will help you doge all the cunning crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the problem is bigger than it seems,<br>because fake education actually robs us of dreams.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just don't know what we could have had,<br>the business of stolen dreams is very sad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to be inspired to learn for real,<br>being force-fed random facts is a raw deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education,<br>has affected each and every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is such an important thing to teach,<br>that a lecture should a long inspirational and life changing speech.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can learn on our own very well,<br>that we are treated like cattle should ring the alarm bell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians, Judges, Presidents, and News Editors,<br>have all been tricked out of education by greedy predators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers don't know they have sold the world,<br>by the time the consequences hit they will be too old.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I call the act of filling our heads with pollution,<br>the problem of substitution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cults do this to their victims too,<br>they plug their victims' curiosities with lies through and through.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Institutions and corporations become corrupt one slip at a time,<br>no one person ever knows the pile of garbage they will climb.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School funding and paycheck money is always the motivation,<br>as it is the one thing that all treat with great ovation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of well educated Politicians,<br>we will only ever witness worsening conditions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Today Politicians hardly know what questions to ask<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and gathering meaningful information is their primary task.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education hurts the entire Humanity,<br>as it takes from our collective sanity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to rise; read books and learn on our own,<br>so that come our golden age we don't have regrets about things that we could have known.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is very beautiful and always meaningful,<br>a life changing book beats a whole week of school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must also become successful business creators, and later, educators,<br>the world is not meant for mere workers and spectators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Do not allow the schools to blame you for bad grades<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>they've been playing this game for decades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And don't let them test you with some test,<br>as you are the only person that needs to be impressed.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is never about learning for the teacher,<br>but learning to enhance your future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real lectures induce life changing knowledge,<br>it is never about merely graduating from college.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education requires real results,<br>because real life, requires real adults.</div>
