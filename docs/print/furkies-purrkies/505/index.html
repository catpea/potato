  <div class="paragraph">Whenever we ask,<br>why didn't they just fight back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The answer is,<br>because they didn't know what to fight for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the oldest trick in the book,<br>keep people inside invisible prisons by hiding the beauty of the real world from them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This has been used by the worst kind of people,<br>and Humanity has gone a long way to almost fix that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is another thing,<br>because lack of knowing, is also a <strong>symptom</strong> of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Cycles of poverty<sup>[1]</sup></span> can only be broken<br>by real education, and universal income.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We can't hope to advance the Human Kind,<br>while keeping the entire world in the social and political construct of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK, to agree to use the concept of money,<br>so as long as there is no poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Otherwise it is not OK,<br>because it hurts people, it keep them in the dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This can't be fixed by welfare,<br>this must be built into the concept of money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A credit card with a very reasonable daily spending limit,<br>that anybody can request.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just a piece of plastic,<br>connected to a special bank that does not keep track of debt or funds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All such a card does,<br>is remove poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It doesn't cause national debt,<br>because that bank does not track that number.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It only causes the elimination of poverty,<br>and almost all crime, and most suffering, and fear, and unfairness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it helps store and business owners grow their businesses,<br>as they now have customers who aren't afraid of going hungry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This little piece of plastic, doesn't hurt economy,<br>it helps it steadily grow.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever stands in Humanity's way to growing up,<br>must be wisely removed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are one family,<br>and nothing should stand in our way to growing up, especially poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty is just as evil as all the other evil things,<br>it must end, because it is hurting us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who argue for poverty,<br>are simply victims of uneducation, victims of never having known joy and peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be a rational argument,<br>to keep ourselves in poverty.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are one family, together we are extremely powerful,<br>and nothing must to stand in our way of growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us learn to keep track of the things that prevent real education,<br>some will be man made, others an emergent property of chaos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us become Knowledgeable, let us become more aware of fake or ineffective education.<br>the Future Generations, and all the Future of Human Kind, depends on us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Depends on each generation,<br>that came before them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We aren't just connected as one family today,<br>we are also connected across all time, from the past to the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It matters,<br>what we do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It matters whether or not we notice,<br>the evil of poverty.</div>
