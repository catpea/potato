      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Letter To The Teacher Community</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was one of your students...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know you can't make the necessary changes,<br>but that does not mean you should <strong>continue</strong> doing what you do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First of all I know a lot of you hate the kids,<br>you hate the way the challenge you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, they challenge you, because they can read your mind,<br>they have a tendency to ask:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What would I have to think,<br>to match the behavior of the teacher"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then they act,<br>like they have no idea who you are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They don't actually care to know everything,<br>they really just care about one question.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whether or not you are a great being,<br>that deserves the respect you demand by means of the chain of threats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In case you missed it...,<br>you are meant to be an inspiration, but you are a threat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are threatening the children with bad grades for which they will be belittled and punished at home,<br>and you are threatening then with being held back for which they will be made fun of and punished at school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The one thing you don't do, is threaten them with anger, when you are angry at them,<br>they see the real you, and they get a confirmation that in fact nothing you do matters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The internet is full of videos with titles like "Teachers Yelling At Students",<br>"teachers losing their temper".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yes, "Students Yelling at Teachers",<br>which shows not how bad the students are, but the results of their parents and your actions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It shows a mind wired for survival,<br>adapting to threats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We could sit here for hours picking the good from the bad,<br>I am going to cut that short, very short.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I am going to say this to you,<br><span>everything you do is bad, all of it<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will give you two examples...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moment children are marked with grades they stop learning for real, and focus on grades,<br>once you split a subject into 45 minute pieces smeared by tests, it becomes meaningless noise that can only be memorized.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This idea of you having a bad day in school, because the kids weren't listening,<br>or acting properly is madness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are putting them in a toxic environment,<br>and you waste their time, with subjects that cannot be integrated into a unified whole - which is what a healthy mind requires.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And have you noticed,<br>that they measure their intelligence with your GPA?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not take very long for us to figure out that you grade students,<br>based on other grades, the C students always stay C students, unless someone makes a fuss towards a B and you grant that as to hide your ways within the noise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone of your students,<br>is a genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every one of them has a beautiful mind,<br>each of those minds is unique, including twins, minds are like galaxies, no two alike.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a special kind of uniqueness within that galaxy,<br>it is the speed of learning, and the sequence in which they must connect their stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a blight,<br>children tent to adopt a culture of the place they are born into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The kid or kids that scare you,<br>that you know are headed for prison.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They had their minds poisoned,<br>and you, who is scared of them - you were their last hope, maybe still are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In case you missed it,<br>teaching is not a job, car repair is a job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parents and Teachers don't have jobs,<br>your kids need you less than you think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are wired for survival,<br>the only thing that can derail them is that blight, the ease with which they are indoctrinated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is not just violence, drugs, or theft,<br>it is also poverty, we teach them to accept their poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In case you are confused why I mention drugs next to poverty,<br>it is because it is a culture that a person is pushed into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No child is an addict, or a thief, or a thug,<br>or poor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are all, equipped with a mind like a galaxy,<br>and an infinity similar to that of cosmos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty, bad parenting, and bad indoctrination,<br>combined with bad or fake education, is what combines to crush those who you think are beyond help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you tag a student as a loser,<br>I hope it is within you to comprehend that you are one of the cogs in the machinery that crushes them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know many of you like to draw a line,<br>and say to yourself that you are not the parent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you aren't just another step in their upbringing,<br>you maybe their last hope.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So when you say that you are not their parent,<br>it means you don't understand anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All you can do is try help the children out of their indoctrination,<br>for as long as you still have your job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After you get fired!<br>you continue on your path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Write, speak, help,<br>rise to become the Great Being that they need, and help others rise along with you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever you think you are doing,<br>is causing more harm than good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the children understand that graduation is a fantasy,<br>and college is more of the same, with the added curse of putting them in debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them see that the only way out, is start-ups,<br>and self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grab them by the hand, especially the scary ones,<br>and help them to see that people will give them some seed money, so that they can expand their ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them know that people want them to succeed in business,<br>and that they will take little more than 10% of their success.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Are you beginning to see now,<br>what your job was supposed to be?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whether or not Socrates said it,<br>he certainly meant it meany times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are wired for survival,<br>they just need to see the truth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is that what they need is tools, like start-ups, like self education,<br>and what they are getting is noise, like your shitty lectures, and the meaningless cut up subjects, and stain of grades that you smear them with, and the garbage of indoctrination that they are getting from most everywhere else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Grab them by the hand, and help them to narrated books at the library, and videos on the internet by real teachers,<br>by those who have been voted on by the <strong>entire humanity</strong> as having something worthwhile to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please, help them, help them to find peace in Museums, in Botanical Gardens, in Galleries and at Art Exhibits,<br>help them to watch over the animals at the Zoo, maybe they can find a way to save our <span>Tigers<sup>[2]</sup></span>, they aren't evil, they are just big Kitty Cats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them become artists with the use of <span>Art Projectors<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>so that they may meditate at the museums that will grant them space.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help them learn to assemble and use 3D printers,<br>so that they may create custom computers and machines for the upcoming climate changes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Make sure that their narrated books never run out,<br>make sure everyone goes home with an mp3 player - let that be the shield, in the absence of real teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rage, rage, to help them to self education,<br>find every magnificent way that will keep them growing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That will keep them fighting their way out of their indoctrination,<br>out that ***** poverty that our use of money put them into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And quit,<br>quit being just a teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Quit being this cog in the machinery that that is only ripping their uniqueness out of the minds,<br>this brick in the wall nonsense must stop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Quit,<br>and become the Great Being that they all once wished, you already were.</div>
