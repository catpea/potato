  <div class="paragraph">It took 5,000 years for us to understand,<br>that global poverty can only lead to the world's end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At 18, a clever lady without any aid,<br>saved the world in less than a decade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She started buying poverty before the world worsened,<br>for 3.5 million dollars per person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was very beautiful and noble,<br>and then all governments joined in and the whole thing went global.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We didn't need borders, we didn't need war,<br>what we needed was wisdom and self control.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 3.5 million dollars was given away,<br>at the rate of one hundred dollars per day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was always money in the bank,<br>truly a system for which the future generations could thank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The governments bought in as they saw it as an investment,<br>and the world became wiser for every dollar they spent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a perfect investment in the future of Human Kind,<br>and most only learned to see that after they gained peace of mind.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It was an international bank without borders,<br>that would never stop taking orders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anybody in the world could sell their non-fungible poverty,<br>improve their well being and expand their ownership of property.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden everyone had a hundred dollars to spend per day,<br>and there was no inflation to run away.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The idea of war,<br>became laughable as every nation opened their door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity became happy and lived in full,<br>no human being as seen as some abstract tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prisons around the world started falling apart,<br>as everyone had a chance to grow wise and smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People could afford to move out of bad places,<br>the world was FILLLED with smiling faces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every school everywhere started teaching wisdom and business,<br>completely repairing the climate mess.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sciences started expanding like crazy,<br>it turned out the students were never lazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is that those who previously worked out of their damn mind,<br>could take time off and put a halt to their endless grind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone felt their intelligence rise,<br>and people all around the world started becoming profoundly wise.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">New businesses emerged all around the world,<br>as that $100 seeded new dreams, and ideas untold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No longer did people settle on the bare minimum,<br>everyone raced to reach their maximum.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out poverty was poisoning our minds,<br>and that the toxic effect of fear, actually. blinds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once everyone saw that they were saved from homelessness and starvation,<br>the world grew in greatness and imagination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We finally became wise enough to leave all the bad ideas behind,<br>and united as one Happy Human Kind.</div>
