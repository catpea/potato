      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Genius Within Us All</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Genius is not meant to stop you or make you feel bad,<br>it is what we become when our pursuits add.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you protect your curiosities from dumb grades and broken school,<br>when you take care to be nobody’s fool...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And take to adventures and narrated books,<br>making sure to avoid all the knaves and crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sooner than later your curiosities will combine and become one,<br>this will be a genius invention, your joy and your fun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you see genius emerges out of doing what you enjoy,<br>not out of a blind pursuit or some mad ploy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It certainly does not come from following somebody else orders,<br>I think that can only be a source of disorders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is not about going the extra mile,<br>but living that life because it is your style.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see what a terrible problem the troublemakers face,<br>they have to force their way forward and keep up the pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who are just dancing around their curiosities whilst having fun,<br>will have them easily outdone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If art calls to you, get a wall projector and paint the biggest canvas you can find,<br>it will be pure joy as you and art are intertwined.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It math calls to you, turn every little lesson to intricate generative art,<br>it is not just about math-smart, the biggest breakthroughs come from the heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you are a travel writer and need material for your tails,<br>then you have to walk the Pacific Crest, the Continental Divide, and the Appalachian Trails.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can only find genius in the things you like,<br>be it art, science, music, computers, or a long hike.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are on an adventure that fits you,<br>your beautiful mind grows greater to expand your knowledge and view.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You should not be surprised to hear that genius is part of us all,<br>the surprise is that so many people think of themselves as small.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like we want everyone to be able to read,<br>we have to remember that curiosities and adventures is something we all need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can’t just go to school and let it rob us of our treasures,<br>the theft of brilliance - is a crime beyond all measures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grades are not real, because we aren’t learning as the subjects are disconnected,<br>in real life it matters not how many useless facts we’ve collected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just look at the <span>overhead projector in your art class<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>the students are so close to perfect portraits, but are forced pass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must not allow anybody to trade our brilliance for anything,<br>no matter how tightly to that promise of a diploma we cling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every other art class should end,<br>with a perfect portrait of a friend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Music composition is easy too<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>you just need to practice with lmms for a day or two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Genius is within us all,<br>in a way, it is what makes us whole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to take a step forward and create some space,<br>because we can only learn independently and at our own pace.</div>
