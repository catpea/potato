      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Magic Of Painting</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Paintings have a truly unique power,<br>they can and should beautifully present things...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That do not normally occur in the real world,<br>that you can't just snap a picture of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am currently working on a group of silly animals,<br>who are not in proportion to each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have proportions,<br>that make a person smile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More over,<br>I think I may dress them up, for adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a portrait I am hoping to somewhat finish today,<br>I am creating a crown of butterflies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where butterflies chose,<br>to land in a fairie's hair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Photography wouldn't really work here,<br>nor would digital photo composition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the butterflies for example,<br>have to create a song together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Splicing photos together can only go so far,<br>here the butterflies will need to shine bright and look cheerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can't look flat, they have to cast correct shadows,<br>and somewhat surprisingly they can't just be a random selection of butterflies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need to create a color theme,<br>privately I can think of two themes Monarch Orange, and Dragonfly Iridescence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just tested random butterflies,<br>and they created confusion - it is great to confuse birds...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But not so good,<br>for a Fairie's Crown which is meant to be pretty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And while photography and photo manipulation is an art,<br>once you need to give your butterflies correct shadows...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are painting,<br>I don't care if it is called retouching - because what it really is, is digital painting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While dressing up a cat for adventure,<br>is an amazing project, especially is your cat has a super short fuse...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is probably better to take a photo of the kitty,<br>who will no doubt be furiously trying to figure out what the heck you are up to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then dress up a doll,<br>and splice the pictures together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At which point, one will have more artistic freedom,<br>when just painting the clothes on, using photos as reference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would be unfair to burden a clever photographer,<br>with so much custom alterations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is where a digital painter,<br>comes in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, digital photography, can go far,<br>but...it gets harder and harder as you go deeper and deeper into the worlds of fantasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Digital painting, on the other hand, especially when using digital photography as reference,<br>makes the entry into the worlds of fantasy fun and easy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, your painting will become much better if you take a moment,<br>to remember; to paint <strong>beyond</strong> what digital photography and editing is capable of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You want photographers to look at your painting and and say,<br>"Well, shucks I couldn't take a photo like that in a million years."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let the world of photography belong to photographers,<br>as to you - the digital painter - belongs the world... of fantasy.</div>
