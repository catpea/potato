  <div class="paragraph">There are no rules in art,<br>because rules cause harm as they box the artist in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creating art,<br>is like walking around a city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is meant to be interesting,<br>and it must not be pre-planned or on some schedule.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is somewhat similar to art,<br>in that it is about curiosities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where the student moves from one storefront, to another,<br>while gaining the abilities to appreciate more things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education is pushing people through at a preset-speed,<br>and in a preset sequence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At which point they abandon their curiosities,<br>and become like a processed sausage whose only aim is graduation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As without graduation, things get even worse,<br>as all those years are wasted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rules, presets, and forced sequences,<br>destroy education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not to mention unforgivable college loans,<br>which destroy the person's future, the opposite of what schools are for.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is the same in art,<br>follow a pattern that has been forced on you, and it is over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All your creations will feel alien,<br>and eventually so heavy, as to make you turn away from art, entirely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In other words you will create art,<br>without actually growing as an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To avoid this, all you need to do,<br>is to visualize your empty canvas as a seed of a tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let it grow,<br>in a way that is most pleasant for you.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I believe deep down both Impressionism and Lowbrow or Pop Surrealism,<br>are rooted in rejection of that which destroys an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may see a silly kitty or person with googly eyes,<br>but what it may be is an act of defiance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A paint balloon tossed at the dirty rules of Academic Art,<br>or some other rule based nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think a lot of funny and silly artworks,<br>are rooted in something surprisingly profound, or wise, or some such.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though, most often a silly work of art,<br>is purely about joy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there is one rule in art,<br>is that you are to cheerful practice a fine disregard for rule.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is how some artists have hundreds of beautiful works of art,<br>and possibly a show on Broadway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While others only have a handful,<br>and tragically seem to disappear after a few years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The serious undertone beneath foolishness,<br>is about realities of life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you box your art in,<br>it will only add to the weight of life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you let it bloom in joy and fun,<br>then it will elevate you, and lift you up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, so as long as you let your paintings grow,<br>you too, will grow, as an artist.</div>
