    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not forget about broken schools we've been to,<br>we did not yet graduate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The school was fake,<br>and so was the graduation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is being held back,<br>by children raised in a different time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And taught in schools so broken,<br>as to be effective fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it will be the ideas that are dear to you,<br>that <strong>you</strong> will strongly stand for in the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why you need knowledge and wisdom and greatness,<br>you must not continue repeating mistakes that have been made before.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our inability to notice slow complex changes,<br>may make it seem like things are just fine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, Poverty, Mass Incarceration, Fake Education, end of Privacy,<br>is a call for urgent repairs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The systems we have build are like computer programs,<br>and like computer programs they can become spaghetti code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These programs must not interfere with Humanity's Progress,<br>as that can only needlessly prolong suffering.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all we do is wait for politicians to pass,<br>their lesser version will step in, and do much the same or worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to build free and open schools,<br>independent of the nations, that they serve in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School cannot charge money,<br>nor does it require teachers when programmed correctly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We get easily confused,<br>from fake education, mostly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We don't need Student Loan forgiveness,<br>all students, including those who have long graduated, <strong>need a Refund</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they still need,<br>a real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And not just an education aimed at making money,<br>but an education that will help them become Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And guard our achievement,<br>and the pace of our progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Relying on poverty to motivate the world,<br>will only lead to desperation, and resulting <strong>devastation</strong>.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, like a computer programs,<br>there are many sides to a thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A school need not come,<br>from the State, or Government or Nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In deed it is best build by the students,<br>that know what needs to be repaired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And and all things,<br>have a root somewhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The thing that holds the world back,<br>has its root in fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody wants to teach for real,<br>and certainty nobody wants to teach for free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Seeing that children do not complain about fake education,<br>because they don't know what real education actually looks like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is a call to action,<br>not a call to resignation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us take,<br>to another side of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us, the former students,<br>build a school that would have worked for us when we were younger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not abandon the children of today,<br>to the education that we know is ineffective.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea of leaving it up to a teacher,<br>to regurgitate some preset problem-and-solution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That fits a standardized curriculum,<br>so lacking in structure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is teems to have been made,<br>for the purpose of rote memorization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is a bad idea,<br>as it only lines the pockets of the aging men who sold the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school is a,<br>library of all our inventions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Along with multiple, well defined, and named,<br>ways of revealing their underlying mechanics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A catalog,<br>of ways of explaining things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it with use of analogies, stories, info-graphics,<br>interactive simulations and laboratories or video an animation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not just teach Arithmetic or Calculus,<br>but the underlying mechanics necessary to make best use of it throughout one's life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is,<br>what a school is for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a project that any one nation can create,<br>it will take all of us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is not a school that can be governed,<br>it must only be a system of paths for use.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let all the other paths,<br>lay exposed for all to see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The paths taken are up to the students,<br>and the paths more traveled by will be most beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And paths must lead away from poverty and towards independence,<br>enabling students with Knowledge that begets Wisdom, which in turn leads to Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness is what paves the road to Wold Peace and Stability, and its flourishing,<br>a blooming world free from poverty and ineffective leaders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A healthy and great world,<br>worthy of all the future generations to whom it belongs the most.</div>
