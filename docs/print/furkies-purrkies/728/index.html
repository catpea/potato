      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Fantastic Realism: Towards Seductive Vampires, Mighty Werewolves, Beautiful Elves, And Mighty Legendary Warriors</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy worlds create beautiful,<br>sometimes scary stories.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is more to it,<br>because as you find comfort in creation of realistic portraits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will surely ponder a new direction,<br>search for things that can enhance your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Adventures into the worlds of fantasy,<br>are one such thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy built on top of realism,<br>creates extremely valuable works of art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And please don't worry, as with portraits,<br>the road towards fantasy is paved with reference images.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But here you move beyond head-shots, and even full body photos,<br>into speaking with color, style, pose, and composition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what schools try to teach us,<br>it is always more responsible to prepare a library of all the reference photos you will need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, I! need butterflies to see if perhaps,<br>my elf painting could use a crown simiular to an 1869 work by <span>Sophie Gengembre Anderson<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A work she entitles with a snippet of a poem by Charles Ede:<br>"Take the Fair Face of Woman, and Gently Suspending, With Butterflies, Flowers, and Jewels Attending, Thus Your Fairy is Made of Most Beautiful Things".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is exactly what you need to upgrade your realistic portrait,<br>to a fairy version.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art is a beautiful adventure,<br>it has a song that will intertwine with yours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If fantasy worlds call to you,<br>than this is your next step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will learn fast,<br>I barely begun and I already outgrew my first three works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My portfolio is down to just six pieces,<br>as if to make room for more fantastic realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My Hoistu! cat does not belong in my art portfolio as it is too silly,<br>still it will make its way to my Art Book, so that nothing is lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The adventure into the words of fantasy,<br>is a thing meant for art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here we can directly speak of color, style, posture and composition,<br>as enhancing those to their maximums brings fantasy to life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must ask if the original color palette of our reference image,<br>can be made better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am currently working on an Elf,<br>and it is worth exploring more skin tones, more glow and fantasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond that, the atmosphere of the world of elves,<br>can lean towards the green like the Matrix, or yellow like Breaking Bread Mexico.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We should call it Color Palette Enhancement,<br>it does not apply to everything, but color adjustments can make your best work even better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The original photo of the elf I am working on,<br>has very simple ears, they can certainly benefit from a bit of extra flourish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is called stylization,<br>where you may enlarge the eyes, make the moth smaller, add or remove shine from hair, or even make the eyes glow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Elves, vampires, robots, and werewolves can all benefit,<br>from glowing eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not have to be an evil glow,<br>just a magical one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stylization of realistic portraits,<br>is best to be kept down to minimum, a glint in the eye, a glow to the hair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But once you cross into he world of fantasy,<br>developing your stylization techniques becomes a superpower.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to get at stylization ideas,<br>is to look at other people's art in search of the ideas they borrowed and developed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you cross beyond realism,<br>and begin to speak with color and added flourish of stylization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will discover the language of the pose,<br>here you can express defiance, attack, power, by bending the shape of the body.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You still use photos for reference,<br>you want things to feel right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now take a loooooong time,<br>to pose your models, and to take just the perfect photo that goes well with the face and will agree with hands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yeah, some people will draw a simplified skeleton,<br>but just like with portraits this is not something you start with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And <span>despite the nonsense art teachers may throw at your feet<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>using simplified skeletons, may be something, that you might want to consider avoiding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like you don't want to paint a portrait from memory,<br>you probably don't want your pose to start with a skeleton doodle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some artists may not wish to use a wooden or plastic model,<br>and pose themselves, or ask friends for help with their reference photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact those reference photos,<br>may dictate where the painting is going next.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here you can easily imagine how a person would be willing to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars,<br>just to own a battling werewolf or armor clad Elf, or battle angel version of themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more you build out the scene in a way that your subject loves,<br>the more valuable that work of art will become for them.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I grew up hearing of a painting so large,<br>that it was said, I could get lost in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I got a bit older I finally went to visit it,<br><span>the painting was the room<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You couldn't walk up to it,<br>as the painting merged with he floor that had real sand and battle artifacts scattered over it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Apparently, you couldn't just jump over the railing,<br>and play with he guns, even though they were already on the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the nature of composition,<br>world building, world speaking, world enticing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like you can't put a relaxed person into a battle painting,<br>you can't just draw any simple background.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The scene behind your character,<br>must be carefully built.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the vampire feels passion,<br>the forest must burn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the werewolves,<br>begin their march, then the night moon must be brighter than the sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If beautiful elves,<br>are dancing, then the world must dance along with-them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if the warriors are preparing for battle,<br>the war hammers and the katanas must weigh upon all the souls.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Even if all you have is one realistic portrait,<br>the gateway to the other universes, is already within your reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Install Krita, get a pen and tablet, grab a reference photo from reddit gets drawn, stretch it over the entire Krita canvas,<br>set opacity to 50%, and let it serve you as the shape guide, and the source of perfect color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May your art begin with Hyperrealism,<br>for there are great universes waiting for you, to open the door.</div>
