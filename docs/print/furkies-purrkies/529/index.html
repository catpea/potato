      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Into The World Of Design</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To enter the world of design,<br>we need a key.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact all the great world beg a key,<br>be it microbiology, programming, astrophysics, or even world expeditions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The key is a simple thing,<br>but before I explain what it is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I must yet again, quickly note,<br>that this key cannot be found among grades or tests, not to mention cramming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The key is an authentic desire,<br>not because job, or fame, or GPA, or career, or showing off, or looking smarter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An authentic desire,<br>a reason to design, doubles as a scaffold that will keep us moving forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning computer programming to graduate and get a job,<br>only works for a little while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a true hunger for art,<br>lasts a lifetime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not end,<br>when the career ends, or one does not get accepted into a brand name school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Of course, we all have this within us,<br>but often times our paths become entangled and we end up moving in directions that don't help us grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to, look into our hears, and discover what it is,<br>that seems fascinating, inviting, what will eventually end up as a stepping stone towards greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The synthetic is when for example a parent demands that her child becomes a doctor,<br>and an authentic urge, is when we follow what calls to us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools nearly fraudulently sell the promise of accessing some career field,<br>but normal people don't even use the words career-field.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Within us is a very delicate system of curiosities,<br>that is all to easy to ignore in haste of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It works like this, when young, we notice something at a museum,<br>as we grow our curiosities slowly take us towards computers, programming, 3D modeling, hardware, 3D printing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And all the while we are shuffling it all together, like cards,<br>to see which of the things we like may fit together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, it just so happens that with museums uploading 3D scans of their treasures online,<br><span>anybody can own a miniature copy of the 3,500 year old Prudhoe Lions<sup>[1]</sup></span> (<span>right<sup>[2]</sup></span>), here is is shared by the <span>The British Museum<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just about technology, in fact it is better to study the 3D model,<br>and make a replica by hand, in air dry clay for example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Making these kinds of connections, is not just about neat trinkets,<br>but learning the art style, mastering various ways with which similar figures can be created...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And exploring and expanding such designs through galleries and exhibitions,<br>and even commercial products, where once could either sell molds or complete concrete casts as outdoor decorations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not design, when someone says "I am going to sell concrete statues and statue accessories",<br>design, is driven by an authentic personal curiosity and passion for some dimension of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while design schools can teach how to use tools, and how it is done,<br>nothing can be done, until one starts by pursuing their art interests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At which point, figuring out how to use tools,<br>is pure joy, and not homework, or any kind of work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter how far we have progressed in life, or how busy in life,<br>the artist and the designer within us, is always waiting for us to slow down, so that the world of art can become relevant to our existence.</div>
