    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If teachers,<br>allowed students to learn what they are interested in</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then they wouldn't need training,<br>to teach students what doesn't interest them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(It is important to understand, that I use the word teach very loosely here,<br>forcing students to temporarily memorize so that they can pass the tests is not education, nor learning, nor teaching.)</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Listen all of this is really important,<br>both for people of all ages. </div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is extremely important,<br>and the reason why it is so hard in the beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is not because we are not smart,<br>but because we can't learn when we are overworked, stuck, or scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That why even narrated books are hard to learn from,<br>not because you are anything short of a genius, but because you can't learn when things are off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bad grades, as ridiculous and laughable as they feel seem to you when you are older,<br>are enough to make the world feel off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look, I don't know everything for sure,<br>it would take 1,000 honest shrinks to look at the modern classroom and define all the problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, we are all human, we have all tasted school,<br>and it may be that schools are preventing us from learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the desperation that arises from this and the threats of being held back, and getting bad grades,<br>all there is, is temporary memorization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But what I am trying to tell you,<br>is that you need real knowledge, because life is real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need real knowledge,<br>because that impacts all your decisions across your entire existence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School is what separates us from cavemen,<br>historical education has been kept away from slaves and servants, to prevent uprisings.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You need books, start with narrated ones,<br>and then begin working on either taking to adventure where you can safely relax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or grow so courageous,<br>that nothing will interfere with you inheriting wisdom, from your loveliest and wisest books.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Schools kill creativity<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and they filter out those who seek authentic education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers have made it so, that that cartoon is correct,<br><span>school is not a place for smart people<sup>[2]</sup></span>, but eventually smart people will fix that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to talk about this,<br>because the solution to this is easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students have to understand that they have been betrayed by the teachers,<br>and take to their own self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that some day, some of them will return, not as teachers that need training,<br>but as those who finally make the necessary repairs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A school that does not provide meaningful, real, and lasting results,<br>that helps the students out of poverty, is not a real school.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Please take good care of your wisdom,<br>and remember to grow all the way up until you become a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe the big lesson to take away from this poem,<br>is that no one should ever trust anybody to teach them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But rather we need to start a tradition,<br>where students are encouraged to learn from the world's wisest books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books written by the world's most celebrated clear thinkers,<br>and intellectuals, who care for fact and realty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Writers who time and again, have helped countless millions,<br>to rise to reason, knowledge, wisdom, and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As we grow we should choose our own path,<br>through the wisest works, and the most brilliant of ideas.</div>
