  <div class="paragraph">Until I came to America I thought Turkey was a nation,<br>then my aunt welcomed us with one, in celebration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember it to this day, it had mushrooms and cranberries,<br>and it made us feel like dignitaries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the only unforgettable mean I've ever had,<br>and to this day makes me very glad.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I knew I had to meet turkeys under better circumstance,<br>and when I got my second programming job in Redford I've met them by chance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a turkey farm on five mile,<br>and I'd always look at them with a smile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was something about my job that made me feel like a turkey too,<br>I was programming in the back, in front of a brick wall, always blue.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I loved working there so much that I became worried something was wrong,<br>I thought and thought, and it was my lovely the turkeys that helped me along,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I realized we can't work for works sake that we must create,<br>my Turkeys taught me that we must each rise and become great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, without delay let us compose a song,<br>let's get a beat going and make it strong.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">What you are about to hear are <span>Tom-tom drum Drums<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>that to me sound like the classical drum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(tom back beat)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This song will be sang by a girl turkey,<br>girl turkeys make squeaks, the gobble gobble sound is the boys.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is a duet of two ladies singing about good times,<br>and mother nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(girls play)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now we will add a little purr and vary the drums,<br>Turkeys purr when they feel cheerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(girls purr)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As we arrange our song,<br>it is a good idea to go back and forth between variations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So even though we have a new movement,<br>we still want to return to what we had before.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And perhaps introduce a new arrangement,<br>where the drums are less prominent, or slower as in this case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(slow)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very hard to create a simple and interesting song out of simple sounds,<br>however by adding a <span>Snare Drum<sup>[2]</sup></span> and <span>High Hats<sup>[3]</sup></span> by ear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As in not following the main song pattern,<br>but rather with focus on making the song more interesting to a human for change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can create a masterpiece,<br>here is what Snare Drums sound like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(snare)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this the sound,<br>of a high hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(hats)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here is the <span>song in full<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>but I must warn you, do not play this song around male turkeys.</div>
