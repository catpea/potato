    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When schools cut up all the subjects into meaningless timed chunks,<br>average intelligence is all one can hope for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is not how real education works, you are not meant to be average,<br>and you are not meant to be like anybody else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you see someone doing things that would take you a long time to learn,<br>you are not seeing a master of all trades equally excelling at everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are witnessing a specialist,<br>a human being who has embraced optimizing a single path of self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are not talented, they are not a genius,<br>they do not have a balanced education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are a ravenous unstoppable force of nature,<br>they are rapidly moving along a unique path that if they lived forever would make them excel at everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will not live long enough to become a master of everything,<br>they will only ever unbreakably, unstopably excel at one thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The human mind only allows a single dense and integrated path that aims toward a single ever evolving area of specialization at a time,<br>it soaks up and integrates new information into the existing body of knowledge, but only when it is compatible, and at the right time, and at the right pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To cut up all human knowledge into tasteless cubes,<br>and force a student to learn all subjects all at once within a uniform time period...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To create a system of curriculum and matching tests,<br>to force-feed the student with standardized knowledge, and then test them with standardized tests...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To graduate them through a misunderstanding of education,<br>whilst encouraging memorization over comprehension...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is to destroy everything meaningful, is to rob the children of dreams,<br>is to lead the world into a miserable state of affairs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The standardized curriculum only exists for the purpose of creating a surface that can be sampled,<br>it has been imagined as a tool that creates easily verifiable data points.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students are pushed through it with a blind force of greed,<br>they are mangled, and stressed, and blinded, and cheated, to sustain a lowest common denominator industry that pretends to educate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Very few teachers, and not all principals realize,<br>that <strong>they</strong> are the men that sold the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have been through this before,<br>every epoch of human advancement has a unique system of thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nation or world wide mistakes are rooted in our noble urge to belong,<br>in case of injustice that urge is exploited and used against us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The greater the organization the more subtle the exploitation,<br>the bigger the thing the harder it is to believe it is wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there are no leaders here,<br>all the people involved have their hand in the cookie jar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They too received a fake or ineffective education,<br>they are convinced they are average and are desperate to put food on their table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The cycle of broken education must end,<br>so that Humanity can start advancing forward at a more rapid pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education curves the minds of people to work mindless jobs,<br>it makes them think they are average sometimes to the point of poverty, violence, and addiction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education helps unique minds grow to their unique heights,<br>it then enables humanity to deal with:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Global warming and climate change water scarcity, water privatization and pollution,<br>pollution, deforestation, desertification, biodiversity loss and Habitat destruction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World hunger, poverty, overpopulation, over-consumption, inequality and discrimination, state-corporate crime,<br>exploitation and displacement, slums and lack of sanitation, human rights violations, lack of transparency and predatory health care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons and nuclear waste, chemical and biological weapons,<br>landmines and war crimes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inability to address these issues, and inability to voters to comprehend what these are,<br>is rooted in schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greed, and the belief that we can divide subjects into testable chunks that are taught all at once within a precise period of time,<br>creates an illusion of education, a factory of mediocrity and inauthenticity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The division of subjects creates a machine that only appears to function like a school,<br>the children are not learning, they are merely performing like actors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one generation is concerned with the future of the next,<br>and yet each generation has direct impact on in - this is not who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education helps children to grow all they way up,<br>where their knowledge and wisdom drives them to become great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not just travel the High School, College, and University pipeline to a job that will keep you above the poverty line, or a career with an office window,<br>do not limit yourself to some temporary prize at a great cost to the next generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Civilizations come to a close when generations stop caring about the world past their own end,<br>you are all the hope the next generation has, as there is little they can do to stop changes that are already in progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom and Greatness represent the final steps in the evolution of our own knowledge,<br>but there is one more step beyond that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The becoming one of the worlds true leaders,<br>ones that do not belong to any nation in particular.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those are the unforgettable beings,<br>that help to steer the entire humanity across countless generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please... get up,<br>grow all the way up.</div>
