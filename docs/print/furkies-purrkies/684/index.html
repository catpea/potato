    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The word books is similar to the word humans,<br>it is a very general label.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody seriously says I don't like humans,<br>likewise, no one should ever say I don't like books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those are silly things to say,<br>in fact they are meaningless statements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is one more, shall we say, similarity,<br>between the word book and human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us go back to our childhood,<br>and revise a group of world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The word spirit, soul, or even ghost,<br>was explained to us as this thing that floats in the air.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But actually, the truth, is that,<br>spirits live in books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A book worth keeping,<br>is a kind of eternity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see this isn't just about you reading books,<br>but you reading your way towards becoming a writer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that you spirit will be captured in your works,<br>and depending on how well you write either titillate or frighten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is very important that you become a writer,<br>hundreds of years from now as we live long and take to space and beyond.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Little known books will become a rare delight,<br>and even before such fancy people deserve to feel you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this way it is true that we can communicate with spirits,<br>because we can reconstruct a version of the author and learn from them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The spirits that books keep,<br>represent a precious one of a kind. intellectual inheritance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than just befriending the author and asking,<br>"What would she do in this situation."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books allow us to inherit the authors, and sometimes their characters' lifetimes,<br>they help us enter the plateau that they climbed and now rest upon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inheriting lifetimes is a precious talent of ours,<br>one that we should make frequent use of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because we can then avoid problems,<br>that the books describe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">In a funny book written by a recovering alcoholic,<br>I noticed this terrifying passage written in context of drinking alcohol - something I always stay away from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If you hang around the barbershop long enough,<br>you'll eventually get a haircut."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here <span>J. Maarten Troost<sup>[1]</sup></span> delivers a lesson that we don't have to learn,<br>that we can just inherit, and <strong>completely</strong> avoid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are many more mistakes that we can avoid in a similar fashion,<br>I think this is by far the most powerful thing about books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what it means to inherit from a book,<br>to hear about the struggle, or challenge, and take into our heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To know where the tragedies are,<br>and go all the way around, and have that, much, more, life, to experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Asking how many books do you have to read is OK, but a bit silly,<br>in a way you only ever really love the top 10.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you were lucky enough to instantly discover your ten books,<br>then the answer is you only need ten of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it is wisdom that you are after, if you care about being powerful!,<br>then 10,000 is guaranteed to light a fire like non other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But realistically, you need to have a good time reading a book,<br>you need wintry walks in the park, lazy days at a lake-or-ocean beach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is still one more important thing you should know about books,<br>a book in its paper form is the most primitive version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best kind of book,<br>is a book cheerfully narrated by its author.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here you will discover a great pleasure,<br>in re-listening and re-learning from books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a great power, as each time you re-listen you grow in wisdom,<br>and each time you become wiser you understand more of the book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here my favorite example is a group of books,<br>written and sometimes read by Bill Bryson.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I enjoy re-listening <span>A Short History of Nearly Everything<sup>[2]</sup></span> the most,<br>there is always litter something I forgot, and something I end up understanding a bit more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not worry too much about the great challenge of writing your own books,<br>it happens automatically when you have something interesting to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just sit down and write,<br>later you divide it all up into separate books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And perhaps pen a few more,<br>once you ask yourself if people of the future will be able to reconstruct your spirit in full.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to great adventures,<br>and don't get lost in mistakes that Humanity keeps propagating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Part of the reason why writing is so important,<br>is helping the future generations start understanding mistakes from where you left off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Climate, Poverty, Loss of Species, Pollution,<br>are not things that are meant to crush you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those are the things,<br>that you have to help the younger generation understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need to understand it all, so that they don't have to start by breaking their way out of that mess,<br>and thus be forced to repeat the road you already traveled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But rather, start far above, where they can comprehend is mechanics,<br>and introduce systems of prevention that will help humanity, increase its pace of advancement.</div>
