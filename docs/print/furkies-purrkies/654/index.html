    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is a multiplier of Knowledge,<br>and you will not learn it in a College.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While it is unfair,<br>to compare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Philosopher needs adventure and thought, not training,<br>while a Doctor must memorize without complaining.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom will help a good Doctor truly see,<br>and help her knowledge grow like a tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is not just about knowing,<br>but learning more and more without ever slowing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom people unfortunately make mistakes,<br>so they really need it for their own sake's.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we all need as much wisdom as we can get,<br>pursuit of wisdom is something we can't afford to forget.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to search for it, for as long as it takes,<br>maybe make an art-form out of avoiding mistakes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When I was frightened in school,<br>I discovered how a bully is just a dull tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they only took to books,<br>they wouldn't have ended up becoming crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their mad lives had been played out countless times before,<br>and for naught was their entire war.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think this was why I early on felt that love of wisdom was important for all,<br>it sets us free and lets us all stand tall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom will also help troubled people convert whatever mistakes they did make,<br>into precious lessons, and finally give them break.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In wisdom people know how to fix things without asking how,<br>and that always makes everything right somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom will convert self blame to self love,<br>and show that mistakes are lessons that they shouldn't dispose of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In wisdom the first book they write,<br>will set all the things right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We live in a poverty and and an overwork system,<br>there is nothing in our culture that encourages to wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just look at how people treat each other in movies and TV,<br>and you will surely agree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom however can counteract all the bad culture,<br>it will enlighten us and give us nurture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And making a mistake is not the end of the world,<br>we simply have to learn to use wisdom, and not just do as we are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of mistakes comes from wanting to be other than we really are,<br>following others so that we belong belong, or being played like a guitar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom helps us grow in our own direction,<br>and will help us see who we really are, through introspection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just expanding into the magnificent bouquet of flowers that we really are,<br>will take us to our bright and unique star.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should really develop that magnificent thirst,<br>and look for wisdom first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Early on wisdom will help us see,<br>and set our minds free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Show us that teachers are pretending to teach,<br>the lessons they share are of little consequence and reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That bullies are just victims of abuse,<br>living a life void of the peace that don't even know they can choose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the same time,<br>wisdom will help us avoid it all, and help us climb.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the heights that we reach,<br>are NOT just a figure of speech.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As that is the up in growing up,<br>growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Otherwise people are merely aging,<br>putting on some show they are staging.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to a good start,<br>I think adventures and wise biographies speak well to the heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reading wise books that make us happy and strong,<br>will teach us class and wisdom, before long.</div>
