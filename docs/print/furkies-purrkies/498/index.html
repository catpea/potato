  <div class="paragraph">I just spotted an antique store,<br>and I am about to show them what I stand for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First I check for all the friendly pets,<br>especially kitty cats I can pet - no regrets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I look for books that can fit my back pocket,<br>found, Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian Tales with a drawing of a rocket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I begin searching for all the cute little things,<br>I find a guitar pick, a little worn by strings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then I hurry to the pocket knifes section,<br>and admire each and every one with great affection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My cheeks start hurting from all the smiles I am doing,<br>but there is so much that needs my viewing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I find a stack of VHS takes and a VCR,<br>it's vintage made my gold star.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My cart is half full with knick knacks by now,<br>all this for $3 dollars, wow!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then I discover a room on the left,<br>military surplus with prices so low it seems like theft.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I find a back pack so large it can carry <em>me</em>,<br>I will use it for firewood as it can fit a whole tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh my gosh, there is an ammo box,<br>it is perfect for my collection of fossils and rocks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a box like this,<br>storing knick knacks is pure bliss.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And then on my way back to the cashier lady,<br>I find a box marked free, which seems a little shady.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But has hundreds of old seashells inside,<br>and I smile wide eyed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tourists are often sad,<br>that there are no seashells at the lake that I am staying at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can totally fix this now,<br>I look at the box again and say, oh wow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After I finished scattering all the shells on the beach,<br>it didn't take very long before I saw someone pause and reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They looked pretty excited from afar,<br>I hope they didn't think that finding a seashell there the was bizarre.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can't believe such a collection of seashells would be free,<br>that was definitely my most favorite antique shopping spree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will never regret finding strange little things in an antique store,<br>and each time you return there will always be more.</div>
