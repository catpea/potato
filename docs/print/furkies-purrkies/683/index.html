  <div class="paragraph">With the brand new winter air,<br>exercising is Spring is without compare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Day by day we get to see Spring spring,<br>until the season is in full swing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This may come as a surprise,<br>but Spring may even decide your exercise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bicycling, dancing, jogging, hiking,<br>a mix thereof or some other thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Spring, is sure to inspire you,<br>to something.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I confess that I may be biased,<br>as for me Spring has always been a blast.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I count the days until first day of spring<br>as you never know what adventure it will bring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also count the days until Groundhog day,<br>I disagree with Punxsutawney Philip, but like him anyway.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">My own exercise had a slow start,<br>as it is after all a form of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I begun by hiking and camping at Nordhouse,<br>and I was as scared as a mouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a thunderstorm like none other,<br>and I thought I wasn't going to make it any farther.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I stayed over four weeks,<br>and came back with rosy cheeks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then to keep going forward I got a bicycle,<br>and one time I got so cold I felt like an icicle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My first and second and third bike fell apart,<br>but it was a great start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From Lake Erie to 14 Mile, I crisscrossed the i-275 trail,<br>it was an adventure on a whole new scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I resumed my jogging adventures a well,<br>that's how I found the i-275 trail.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Jogging has been very hard for me,<br>until dancing set me free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jogging never helped me jog better,<br>but dancing made it so that I can run longer, and in any weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dancing enhances endurance and strength,<br>and then you can jog any length.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In time I'll learn to jog faster too,<br>that is something that's on top of my to-do.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going full speed is not wise,<br>one should start with a slow and long exercise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it is hard to decide,<br>and not all can easily jog or ride.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Spring makes it so that nobody gives up,<br>they often start by hiking muttering "I ain't no buttercup."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's why I think it is best to set New Year's resolution for Spring,<br>because it helps us with everything.</div>
