  <div class="paragraph">You will need more than general knowledge,<br>and the database class where the teacher is absolutely convinced his way is the only way, is nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way you would know this, is not from a book,<br>but from years of coding your own version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Code for memory only, with periodic disk sync,<br>for non volatile memory that survives a reboot, distributed hash tables spread across network computers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This grants you a wonderful component of your greater exceptional ability,<br>and the prof is in publishing it on the internet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Writing interesting things about it,<br>or tutorials, or setting up a plugin ecosystem for others to extend it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Draw a concept of mind map of your abilities and curiosities,<br>and that will make the root of your tree of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The map reveals your constellation of knowledge,<br>your curiosities will display the directions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You never travel for long, weeks at most,<br>and then you leap to the next curiosity, making a circle across what interests you.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You will start becoming an expert in many fields,<br>and all of them will be dictated by your own curiosity as it expands with each new thing you learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Exceptional abilities is a tool for thinking,<br>that helps people cut through ineffective education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That also means diplomas begotten by memorization without comprehension,<br>which results in disconnected non-functional knowledge.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Put yourself in the interview room at a decent company,<br>in an authentic interview, by wise leaders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All they will want from you,<br>is to see all your inventions, and how proud you are of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will want you to talk about your lightweight in-memory database,<br>the art lectures you sell online, your successful side projects.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They want proof of functional knowledge, that adds up to create something brilliant,<br>that is what exceptional ability means.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Having a portfolio full of exceptional things,<br>that is the only way that your abilities can be correctly described.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must accept the responsibility for your own self education,<br>we can't be taught outside in, we can only learn inside out.</div>
