    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to jump on my bicycle this evening as the sun was behind clouds,<br>but it didn't look like it was going to rain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I packed this and that, and put some fancy futuristic electrolyte mix in my water,<br>I squi–Øted a bunch of fragrant bug repellent on myself, and boy did it work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And as I was just about to leave,<br>I discovered I had a flat tire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My goodness, entire books can be written on the art of fixing a bicycle flat,<br>it seems like an easy fix, but it is trouble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First of all, I was lucky this time that I was home,<br>my first flat tire happened many miles away and I had to walk, and jog back home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Half way through I had to drag the bicycle as the tire assembly came completely undone,<br>I actually tried to refill it at a gas station, just about all I had was some quarters for the air machine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't remember how that worked out,<br>It was a stressful moment, because of how far away from home I was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I eventually left the bicycle at a Highway Rest area,<br>and then jogged to get my car, got on the highway drove to the rest area and picked up my bicycle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was an old bicycle from a garage sale,<br>and it had a huge problem with the pedals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once I fixed the tire I went to a pricey repair shop for expensive bicycles,<br>and eventually caught on why the mechanic was acting slightly odd, and I asked:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is this a cheap bicycle".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, he said with a deep tone,<br>and a kind of a detached relief that I caught on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up with a neat mountain bike,<br>and when it started wearing out, I got a Fat Tire bike.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I learned a lot, all these bikes are super cheap,<br>and the more things they have, the more things will get broken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My Mountain Bike had disc brakes,<br>but I had to adjust them a number of times, and never quite got it right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, I fell from my bicycle, and bent the aluminum frame,<br>and pretty badly too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fat tire bike, has no extras,<br>it has no special brakes, by the handle bar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To stop it there is a break built into the internal pedal assembly,<br>it triggers when you move the pedals back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As little as there is to go wrong, things still go wrong,<br>I actually had to go back to the store and get a replacement bicycle because the brake failed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I added an extra bracket to the replacement bike,<br>to prevent the same failure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then a tire went out,<br>at I got a second Fat Tire bike, exact same thing, it was on sale for $135 dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I maybe trying to fix that tire tomorrow,<br>but I don't think it is going to work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first bicycle wisdom, is,<br>have two cheap bicycles, this way you never have any down time, and no surprises, you can ride your good one and fix the broken one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the tools and maintenance items that have ever touched your bicycle,<br>have to ride a long with you, and you have to check them for damage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ran over a pointy stick in my second Fat Tire bike,<br>and my back tire exploded, the stick actually flew up in the air.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hole is still there, and the inner tube is unprotected in that spot,<br>it is slightly larger than a pencil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This happened about eight miles from my apartment,<br>and while I had all the tools, the glue on the stickers for my inner tube dried out, as did the little used tube of tire cement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My tire repair kit was too old,<br>I walked a mile or two to a gas station, and had my parents pick me up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The next day I used another bicycle, to get to my fat tire bike, repair its tire so that it would spin,<br>and then I slowly rode back on one bicycle, while holding the other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Somewhere in there, my phone fell on concrete, and just stopped working,<br>and I ended up getting a new phone number with my el cheapo replacement phone, yikes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another time, for the world in me, I was unable to locate where the puncture was,<br>and I tried like crazy, soap bubbles and everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I actually had to go to the supermarket and get a little plastic kiddie pool,<br>then I filled it with water and soap, and only then found the microscopic puncture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wisdom for this problem is, find the piece of metal that punctured your tire,<br>and then carefully examine the inner tube in the same spot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to do some detective work,<br>it does not have to be a very big hole to deflate a tire overnight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was lucky today, I found a very old roofing nail,<br>this thing could be from 1920's, you can see the structure of the metal, it looks like the top half of a nail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But even so, because I didn't notice the flat tire for a few of days,<br>the rubber structure got out of shape, and that is really bad news.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because, all tires, are ever so slightly larger than the metal rim they sit on,<br>this is on purpose, this gives you the much needed wiggle room to take the tire off of the rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you have to use a little plastic wedge, I had one of them snap on me today,<br>without that extra wiggle room, it may not be possible to take the tire off the rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The part of the tire that touches the metal rim has metal wires in it,<br>there is no stretching there, you only get the wiggle room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used my remaining two wedges to negotiate the tire off the rim, but only in the spot where the nail was,<br>that allowed me to grab the inner tube, and pull it out, and then I used some "bubbles" to verify that a tiny little black dot I spotted there, was the problem spot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need multiple tire repair kits, just in case you break off that little wedge,<br>or end up buying a kit that is so old that all of the glue died out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They weigh nothing, they take up no space,<br>just get three different brands or styles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time I noticed an abandoned bicycle, and then few minutes later a gentleman hurrying to Ford. Rd.,<br>I flat out asked him if he need a tire repair kit and held out one of my unused, unopened boxes, it was the good stuff too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was like "Dude?", he had his phone with him, and my guess was that he called one of his friends to pick him up,<br>they were going to go to the store get a kit and he would go back to fix his bicycle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I turned an hour long problem,<br>into five minutes of nuisance, he already knew how to fix tires, he even had a no-nonsense air pump with him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just the moment he took the kit, I took off,<br>but I learned from him to get a no-nonsense air pump.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Using the little ones is crazy to me,<br>I got one for $11 buck or so, and it didn't seem to work at all, I am pretty sure the one I have is good motorcycles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I actually ended up buying Velcro straps to attach it to my handlebar,<br>it takes like 30 pumps to fill a tire, it is awesome.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I scratched up the surface where the little hole was with sand paper,<br>I put a layer of glue on it, then I used a fresh square of rubber that also had some glue on it, and when that dried, I added extra glue around the edges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Always do a glue sandwich,<br>put the glue everywhere, the glue that is on the patch is not very good, you need glue that is hermetically closed in an aluminum tube.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the difference between walking and riding,<br>serious business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I ride my bicycle early spring,<br>there are metal wires, and nails everywhere, from construction, maybe snow plows pushing highway garbage onto the trail...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and certainly from that steel wired inner part of truck tires,<br>once a tire falls to pieces, and patches of that rubber and steel start decaying after some years, it becomes like little needles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once I put in the inner tube, and inflated it, in those 30 pumps or so,<br>my bicycle tire came apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Probably mostly because the tire was deformed,<br>from sitting flat for a few days until I noticed it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This deformation, will combine with that little wiggle room you have,<br>to make it so that your tire just comes apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That wiggle room, when the tire is perfectly centered around the rim,<br>disappears completely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to inflate your tire just enough,<br>to start walking your bicycle in circles, and let things balance out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let that deformation lose the hold over your tire,<br>let the tire distribute it self around the rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just do a few circles walking the bike,<br>and then resume inflating it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For myself, just to be sure,<br>I stopped a second time, and got on the bicycle and rolled forward an back, to get that wiggle room to distribute it self perfectly around the metal rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It took a couple of tries, so be patient, rinse and repeat,<br>that wiggle room is not your enemy, it is there so that you can take the tire off the rim, and fix your flat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But as you are inflating the tire, roll the dough,<br>massage the tire into the center, so that the wiggle room is not in any spot, or your inner tube will push the tire apart in that spot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not inflate with wiggle room present,<br>or things will get frustrating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time, when I still had my Mountain Bike,<br>I've noticed a boy pushing his bicycle really hard with the chain being stuck between gears and those spokes that hold the rim up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He said he wanted a movie, so he grabbed a bicycle, and this thing just fell apart, can I fix it,<br>I think I got it going, he was really shaken up, he was not having a good time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't think I just left him there pushing the damn thing forward,<br>I probably pulled out the chain, and put it back on the gear, but also would have warned him that this won't hold up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He said he went to a nearby repair shop and they wanted money,<br>for him using their tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was coming back from one of my longest adventures, I was tired,<br>but I am certain I put the chain back on, though at the time, I didn't know enough about bicycles to push his rear tire back and tighten the chain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I do remember however that, that after I did whatever I could, I went to the repair store,<br>and said that the boy is really shaken up, and that we need to help each other, and my voice broke, I closed the door an went on my way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I told several people about that heartlessness and laziness,<br>and told them to avoid that store, they are overprices and reek of predatory behavior.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The big wisdom here, is to stop inflating the tire about 30% in,<br>and roll the dough, get that tire in the center of the rim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And before you take off with your patched tire,<br>triple check that you got all the tools back into your bicycle bags.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anything and everything that is used to service your bicycle,<br>has to be mounted on the bicycle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was already 8:45 when I left, so it was going to be dark on my way back,<br>while I had my flashlight, I forgot my headlamp, not good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I remembered bug spray, always remember bug spray,<br>4 miles in, about half way through my ride...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My left pedal started feeling loose, the thing was going to fall off in 10 minutes flat,<br>and if I was unlucky I would lose the assembly that held it in place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was getting dark, and the moment I stopped mosquitoes were all over my face,<br>there were so many of them, that I just ended up spraying them with bug repellent - and I did not get bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I needed the correct tools, and one of those fun wrenches that makes a fancy sound,<br>and since the screw holding a pedal is inset in the pedal, I needed a socket thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because I keep all the tools on the bicycle,<br>I had everything with me, and the repair took two minuets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The socket thing was slightly too big, metric probably,<br>but with mosquitoes flying around my face I didn't have time to look for the correct thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wisdom here,<br>always have all the tools on the bicycle, everything that ever touched your bicycle, because you never know what will break next.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In return for my preponderates,<br>quick repairs to my tire, and successful field repair of my pedal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I got to see a Gentlemanly Raccoon cross my road,<br>and when I said "Hello, Mr. Fancy Raccoon, How Do?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It actually paused for a split second,<br>and turned his ear towards me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As if wondering,<br>how in the heck does he know my name?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a little know fact, that when a raccoon crosses your road,<br>you are granted over one hundred years of cheerfulness, health, handsomeness and good looks.</div>
