  <div class="paragraph">"The only thing you have to fear is fear it self",<br>holds true for growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like the power of endurance,<br>which just takes a couple of years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And demand that we <strong>gradually</strong> increase,<br>the workout load and complexity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have many superpowers,<br>stored behind some impossible to skip things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a word,<br>only the worthy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact there are superpowers,<br>we shouldn't just speak of in passing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just out of respect for those,<br>who used them to overcome human cruelty and rise above it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Helping you understand what that means,<br>is noble enough to yet again call upon Dr. Frankl.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.<br>They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:<br>the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can invent Philosophies and even Fantasies as the cases is with religion,<br>to shield our minds and grant us ten minutes more to no end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No such thing can be conjured up at the snap of fingers,<br>like in superhero movies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like with endurance workouts,<br>it is a result of some challenging sum of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When Dr. Frankl states that Success will ensue,<br>that also holds true for superpowers, they ensue from the choices we make.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue,<br>and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself<br>or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.<br>Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it."</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Such is the case with Genius,<br>we are not just capable of it, we are pre-disposed for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is a requirement,<br>a series of pursuits, that eventually, add to become more than the mere sum the parts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Genius is born from having explored so many things,<br>that they create a body of knowledge, that we can apply by subtle analogy, to problems we have never encountered before.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important,<br>that we define our terms at this point.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Genius is not a positive word,<br>it a a narrow-mined and elitist word, often used to belittle others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And most commonly, ti has the effect,<br>of tricking a person into thinking:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Since I am not a genius,<br>I will never become as great as <strong>that</strong> person"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What you are really thinking of when using the word Genius,<br>is Lover Of Wisdom, or Philo-Sophia, or Philosopher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a Philosopher is an important part,<br>of growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And growing all the way up,<br>means, becoming a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In other words,<br>the wisest possible you...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That you become,<br>when you don't let fear stop you from growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most common fear that we all experience,<br>is the fear of homelessness and fear of being hungry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what lies at the very bottom,<br>of the structure that we construct to push ourselves away from it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a wiser world this would be the correct thing to do,<br>though this would be a simple political issue and no Human Being would even need to ponder it much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like almost everyone on earth today,<br>is born free, and not to slavery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the future arrives,<br>we will not have to worry about hunger and homelessness exactly the same way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the imperfect world that we live today,<br>School, Grades, GPA, Student Loans, including advanced degrees...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Followed by career paths, work health balance, impact of career on family and our mental and physical health,<br>and finally the issue of living life instead of spending our best years in an office cubicle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are incomplete, some have become corrupt,<br>the idea of pressing a bad grade upon a child easily able to become what most all genius or gifted with the correct training.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even by handing a child an A,<br>we are already warping their perception of intelligence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Presenting the notion of inferior students,<br>and forcing the student into obedience rather than intellectual independence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The matter of mental health is the second most important example,<br>while students are suffering mental health issues due to ineffective education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Symptoms of which reveal themselves in thinking "drugs are cool", "you got to try this, Dude",<br>or thinking that to become a man, one needs to get laid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This notion of getting lucky, is actually a <span>predatory attack<sup>[1]</sup></span> on an an emotionally unhealthily person",<br>a person who would not be in that place, had they been well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just alcohol that warps a person's mind and render consent invalid,<br>misfortune, pain, misery, misunderstands are far more unraveling than drugs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the question of mental health,<br>gets even worse as we start growing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This structure we built away from hunger and homelessness,<br>with things that often take advantage of us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like student loans, especially as the degree we aim for becomes more advanced,<br>and jobs that pay as little as they can, never adjust for inflation, and replace us as soon as they can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prevents us from easily finding serenity in life,<br>by means of stress and fear, and even more complex things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Such us forcing us to make choices to prevent us,<br>from staying on the road of growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Almost everyone gives up on adventure,<br>to maximize their performance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly, and seemingly reasonably we depart,<br>from our sacred roads of wisdom growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, that is not reasonable,<br>not only is it your right to become the wisest you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also when people fail to reach that state,<br>the world stops advancing forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A humanity that does not advance,<br>is stuck in a circle of inauthentic politicians, and unhinged dictators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today the person who deices whether or not Nuclear War is about to occur,<br>is clearly a creature whose mind has long unraveled</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today, a person who does not wince a the loss of 30,000 lives,<br>and some 75,000 injured, decides the fate of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to prevent the repeat of this situation,<br>some 20 years from now with a dictator next door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is to stop being afraid of the things that are preventing us from growing up,<br>like going hungry for a while or being homeless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To give an extreme example, of people who are doing just that, and in <strong>no uncertain terms</strong>,<br><span>consider all those currently walking the world's greatest trails from start t o end and book in hand<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to fully explain the gravity of the necessity of goring all the way up,<br>and the impact a wiser and more advanced world has on Education, Politics, and The Wold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we can look back in history,<br>to men and women who were just as intelligent as you and I...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But were unaware of Philosophy, Geometry,<br>or that they can use charcoal from their fire to create hyper-realistic portraits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They were too stressed out, too caught up in daily matters,<br>all too obedient to whatever flavor of ruler presided over them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't even have to go back to the ancient times,<br>juries from just a few decades ago thought they were wise for supporting American Segregation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would not occur to majority of them, to stand up to a judge,<br>in fury, in rage, and dignity an nobility and authenticity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just like it does not occur to you, to stand up to a judge today,<br>and in fury and rage scream that retribution is vile and evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is even without considering the fact,<br>that our criminals are just normal human beings who have been made often permanently ill by poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty that we tolerate by not rising to greatness,<br>that we sustain by never challenging it as a stupid f&cking idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a sentence by doing nothing to prevent the situation where people are fractured by poverty,<br>we are creating our criminals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be easy to say,<br>that we are doing so by means of ignorance, or sometimes arrogance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But actually, it is our global culture,<br>and the lack of advancement, the lack of us taking the responsibility to face all fear and grow all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The same exact thing separates Middle Ages from Modern Days,<br>and we call it culture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few monks aside, the culture in middle ages did not include reading books,<br>or aiming to advance the world, pas the local settlement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Famous thinkers aside, we both share the same mistake,<br>the mistake of thinking that we can't be geniuses, or that growing all the way up is optional.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a cultural,<br>mistake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You were born a Genius,<br>but you didn't know, because the modern culture makes those people seem genetically superior, and they are not.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Einstein was riding imaginary trains<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br><span>Hawking spinning backwards<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Newtons three laws are child's play<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>the apple didn't hist his head, he merely wondered what would happen if he kept throwing it farther and farther.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What made those people special was not their inventions,<br>it was that they chose not to stop but kept going forward on their own path aiming to become their wisest selves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each of these three men had difficult lives,<br>children of today can accomplish far more...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as our culture helps them understand,<br>that the only fearsome thing there is, is fear of the unknown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the fear of the unknown,<br>is so terrible, because if we don't know to ignore it, or challenge it, we will not grow up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In which case Humanity will fail to advance,<br>and will <span>continue repeating the same mistakes in a MAD circle<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our culture is missing an important component,<br>the tradition of parents asking their children to grow all the way up until they become wise and great beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because of the continued nuclear thereat of uneducated leaders stockpiling world destroying weapons,<br>we all have grew up under the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In that way,<br>the houses that we have built are houses of cards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than pursuit of career and paycheck,<br>by means of hoop jumping ineffective education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must rise to stand in relentless pursuit of greatness,<br>that is the only way that humanity can advance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until then, Humanity <strong>will be</strong> locked in a circle,<br>repeating its mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All it takes is preventing fear,<br>from interfering with us, growing all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't be scared of the uncertainty,<br>that comes from continued authentic self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not tolerate ineffective education,<br>if you are not learning in school, take to self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The modern age gives you the opportunity,<br>to listen to all the books that you need to continue growing all the way up - it has never been easier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not feed the profiteering gluttons behind college loans,<br>and actors and celebrity politicians; exactly what they want you to give them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not build a house of cards,<br>under the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rise and take to wisdom initializing a culture of growing all the way up in Dignity and Authenticity,<br>to your family, and the future of younger generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us advance our culture today,<br>as there are far too many threats in not too distant future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This poem begun with "The only thing you have to fear is fear it self",<br>explaining that authentic wisdom is better than inauthentic education and careers likely to have negative impact on mental health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us end by paraphrasing another president,<br>"Our problems are human-made, therefore they can be easily solved by humans."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us use our predisposition for Wisdom and Greatness to undo our mistakes,<br>and grant the younger generations, a bright future - without a worry in sight.</div>
