    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The school taught,<br>artists...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are forced to think<br>that using original colors is wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they call this beautiful invention,<br>color picking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They don't see the beauty,<br>of the process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The light coming through the lens,<br>the microchip and being captured in a file, and framed in a theory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This color is precious,<br>it is a gem, a true ray of light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They also call,<br>the direct use of reference images: paint-overs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again,<br>they were tricked by teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers who took credit for their talent,<br>as we all have the talent for art...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers just want to put food on their table, and look good,<br>so they'll put on a show that delays real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To truly capture the shape,<br>one has to use either Photogrammetry or a 3D modeling program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not possible to capture shape with a grid,<br>because we have a great responsibility to the people in our paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are not to imagine themselves in them,<br>but to recognize themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The names "color-picking", and "paint-overs",<br>are crafted to belittle you, to enhance elitism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I want to underline here,<br>that use of real colors, and reference images - IS A TEACHER.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a teacher 10,000 more powerful than any human,<br>it is also a gateway into very powerful art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers and basically students that were made mad,<br>by the fraudulent teacher, have fraudulently shut that gateway for many people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They shamed them out of claiming their artist abilities,<br>abilities that they already had, that they only needed some basic help to access.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this way the story of art,<br>is a great tragedy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a story stained by hate,<br>elitism, theft, and lies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You were born an artist,<br>you have always been an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a great and precious power,<br>this is why people will try to lie, cheat, and manipulate you away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must not allow people to shame you away from art,<br>use the original color use reference images - directly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">YOU WILL NEVER FIND A BETTER TEACHER,<br>NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, EVER.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'll let you figure out on your own,<br>what kind of people shame others out of beauty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But be ready,<br>be ready to push back the shame.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a couple of morons that once thought they could corner Richard Dawkins,<br>while the words they used went together, their logic was complete sh*t...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Richard's response was as fine and classy as always,<br>and you should use that on the elitist art bullies and fake teachers that are sure to stand in your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just respond to their arguments of doing it their way with,<br>"<span>If you're convinced by that kind of thing... you're welcome<sup>[1]</sup></span>"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And turn around, and continue learning<br>by means of real colors and correct shapes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take them 10 years what you,<br>what you can easily accomplish in two months.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are just doing what you are doing,<br>though, with extra and steps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But know that the price they pay,<br>is enormous, as fake education is the worst thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By not trully tasting real colors,<br>they will never invent color studies from within themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will never touch perfect shaped undivided by grids,<br>and their studies will be corrupted from beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What can one teach the eye,<br>by training it with slightly misshapen portraits?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By contrast when you work with real shapes,<br>you are navigating the perfect map of a city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You learn how to get around,<br>from the mirror image.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In order for your eye to eventually know when the shape is wrong,<br>you have to study the correct one.</div>
