    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For a while now I have been noticing the delay/echo effect in songs,<br>it was <span>Giorgio Moroder<sup>[1]</sup></span> that helped me hear it first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>He actually called out for it, at one of his performances<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>I never used a delay effect, prior to hearing that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was replicating it with 16th notes,<br>but it never quite worked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even in the beginning when he first says,<br>"<span>Danny, give me a click<sup>[3]</sup></span>" it is a deeply complex sound.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not a click,<br>not; a click.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If your mouse made that click,<br>then you'd probably need earplugs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bet all the songs are using reverb and delay, and echo;<br>and a range of things that multiply the sound waves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I tested it in lmms,<br>and the sound is powerful and, well... full.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and lmms has a range of echo, delay, and reverb effects,<br>but something seemed a bit off. </div>
  <div class="paragraph">I guess, I am jealous of all the fancy instruments,<br>even though I wouldn't know how to use them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I took a moment,<br>to search for an alternative to lmms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I found an open source program called MusE,<br>the current 4.0 version got a face lift.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I was able to make some drum sounds,<br>before you use the drum track, you have to define your samples (or sound files).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I feel that <span>composition in MusE is something important to research<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>I set it aside for a tiny moment and turned to programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I went back to the part where Giorgio Moroder mentions his notes,<br>and <span>Alba Ecstasy<sup>[5]</sup></span> mentiones Ping Pong Delay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And <span>I wrote the tiniest bit of code to frame both, by mans of Tone.js<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>you can hear it play Giorgio's three notes with Ping Pong Delay at <span>https://catpea.github.io/berliner/<sup>[7]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not a song, it is just 3 notes,<br>but they sound really good because of that ping pong delay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Tone.js<sup>[8]</sup></span> is a layer on top of Web Audio which is a program based on trees of nodes, or graphs,<br>it should integrate quite well with <span>Rete, The JavaScript framework for visual programming<sup>[9]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be quite easy to introduce <span>Tidal music notation<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>it is a nice project to learn programming with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think Berlin School Techno,<br>would be neat to explore with a combination of Tone and Rete.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Personally and in closing, I have a lot more to learn about Computer Music,<br>before I sit down to writing such marvels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I feel I have to study the history of Electronic music some more,<br>there are many more musical treasures and fancy ideas to be discovered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Earlier in the day I was thinking how music more than anything else,<br>paints a beautiful picture of humanity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no limits here,<br>no borders.</div>
