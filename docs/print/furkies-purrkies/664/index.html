  <div class="paragraph">Bicycling, Jogging, Backpacking, and Day Hiking at a nice location,<br>is a nice way to <strong>become and stay</strong> fit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I recently came across an article that mentioned,<br>dancers practice for five hours per day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to start a fitness journey,<br>by dancing for five hours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is easy to explore for five hours,<br>with plenty of breaks at first.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">An argument can be made that it is too expensive,<br>to just explore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it need not be,<br>exploration for exploration's sake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All explorers, traditionally,<br>explored for money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All it takes, is a set of interesting ideas,<br>that when combined together crate a small and stable income.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Taking pictures at all the state parks,<br>and creating an archive of park photographs, that call for a licensing fee.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Combined with an independent state park directory with maps,<br>that can be purchased as an app or Printed On Demand on paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Combined with expanding the archive to include all seasons,<br>so that hunters as well as hikers will find it useful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Combined with setting up cell cameras that show game,<br>and/or take time lapse photographs to make a year round park preview.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And a website/video-channel,<br>that allows for advertising.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Can create a small stable business,<br>that involves a lot of travel and nature walks.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">To start all one would need is videos,<br>of visiting and exploring the sites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People searching for Nordhouse Dunes, or Ludington State Park,<br>would find the videos, ads, related products, etc.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is a lifestyle change,<br>be it gym or adventure - it is a lifestyle change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while in most cases, these are small amounts of money,<br>a healthy lifestyle is priceless, and it avoids hospital bills as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Working a stressful and unhealthy job, that pays well,<br>may not pay as well as it seems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to consider well being, mental health, impact on out longevity,<br>and subtract those values from the weekly paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect there are jobs out there,<br>that put a person well in the minus, and are a terrible idea.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Adventure Fitness not just body health,<br>but mind health as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is about Great Happiness,<br>and Strong Muscle.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Let us not be so quick to choose a stressful career,<br>as in the long it may cost us in health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Daily stress and a sedentary lifestyle,<br>across several decades is sure to have negative impact on body and mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fitness shouldn't be something that only some people do,<br>as it is part of our health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fitness should be part of our work,<br>and home life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may not be a question of falling ill today,<br>but it certainly is a question of preventing illness later on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not be so easily impressed by stressful careers,<br>in industries that would fail, had they considered our well being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, it is one of the Great Mysteries of Adventure,<br>that it pays not just in health, but in wisdom too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A healthy lifestyle will ignite creativity and call to great ideas, and books, art and music,<br>it is a cheerful lifestyle full of great little destinations and fine memories.</div>
