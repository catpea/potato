  <div class="paragraph">Well, from time to time,<br>a local train blocks the way to or from my adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because the main road goes above the track,<br>and only bicyclists take the old stretch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The trains can be parked there for hours,<br>the only other way to get across is the above overpass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did it once,<br>but it was very dangerous, and there were large holes in the road.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no way to get home,<br>but to hop over the train.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A gentleman was already fidgeting on the other side,<br>he must have been waiting for a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I arrived at the tracks,<br>the breaks made a sound, but it was nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We waited and waited,<br>until the gentleman decided to throw his bicycle over the assembly connecting the train.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I grabbed the bicycle he threw to the ground and dragged it off to safety,<br>as he made his crossing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">It was my time to go, and seeing that I was helpful,<br>he offered to help me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But my tank of a bicycle was already half way up,<br>I got it up on the train car platform in a single go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He had a sports bicycle, it was light, small, and bouncy,<br>my bicycle needed to go up on the train, then then I need it to push it to the other end, and pull it down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I quickly replied, "No, this is just part of the adventure.",<br>and he was already answering his own question "No you don't need help."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As my bicycle, wallet and phone, became part of the train cargo,<br>I had to hurry!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get on top of the train,<br>I had to use the ladder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you know what, the moment I grabbed on to it,<br>I felt like I belonged there - like I was destined to be a train engineer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I am a very quiet and a well mannered person,<br>as I pulled my self up on the ladder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I let out a great big.<br>"Heeeeeeeee Hawwwww!".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ladder had only one real step,<br>but it worked well, and it gave me a good and refreshing cat like stretch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moment I got on top of the train though,<br>I really don't know what got into me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I looked at the stranger who was some feet away,<br>and yelled "If I don't make it down from here, I am headed to Ohhhhh Hi...O!".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The stranger quickly hurried away after that,<br>and it was now my bicycle, my wallet, my phone, and I who was the cargo - Yikes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As I was standing up there gathering my thoughts,<br>I realized - this is pretty wild in contrast to my FreeCAD tutorials - and decided to get down as quickly as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I led my tank of a bicycle, now for some reason 50 pounds heavier across the car,<br>and rather than going back for the other ladder decided to jump down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I haven't jumped this far down since I was showing off when I was eight or ten or so,<br>instantly I misjudged the height, and as I thought I was about to land, I had a foot to go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I landed as gracefully as a Great Warrior,<br>Arrr!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I grabbed my bicycle,<br>and pulled it down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just like that,<br>my adventure in the middle of an adventure - was over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was no longer a train hopping hoodlum and no goodnik punk,<br>I was now an ordinary bodybuilder with a tank for a bicycle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one will even know,<br>that I almost made it to Ohio.</div>
