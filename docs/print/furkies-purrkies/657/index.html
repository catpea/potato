    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Drawing is not something you try to learn,<br>drawing comes automatically as you work on your comics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It won't take very long before you are doing free hand panels,<br>but don't start with drawing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because art, will only give you what you want,<br>if you give it something it wants.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art wants creation, longs stories, lovely stories,<br>but above all art want you to enjoy yourself without making sacrifices.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't just sit home all the time, practicing how to draw,<br>you have to live a beautiful life too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To give art something to begin with,<br>you will need to make a trip to the pet store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reason we pick the pet store,<br>because the toys there are not treated very well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They get torn up and eaten,<br>so you save a couple.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you have your dolls,<br>get a camera with a tripod.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Give them a nice bright background,<br>and light up the scene so that it looks sharp in a photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a long time to do your photo shoot,<br>pose the dolls together, use sticky tape, use a wire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you have 20 to 50 nice an interesting photos,<br>get them on the computer and project them on a canvas with a digital projector.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Go big,<br>a single panel in a comic book should the the size of a painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact it may become a painting,<br>it may sell for more than a painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may end up getting into a gallery or hanging up your works at a coffee shop,<br>and then selling your comics there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And trace, when making cartoons the outlines should very tick,<br>almost twice as thick as the inner lines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a magical trick you can do here,<br>if you choose not to paint eyes, but this is somewhat advanced.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you take the time to create a library of eyes,<br>then you can stick them using magnets on the canvas, this will change the mood of your scenes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But don't worry about that at first,<br>leave this idea for later.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you have a few photos painted on paper with acrylic paint,<br>and outlined with acrylic markers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You go into a second photo shoot,<br>but here you take pictures of your paintings, not the dolls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imperfections and textures,<br>give art a soul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each and every one of your scenes will come to life,<br>as you arrange them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you have guessed by now,<br>the sequence in which your story is told is second to your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a little bit like shooting a movie first,<br>and then having the movie editor create an interesting story out of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a little backwards,<br>but each and everyone of your panes will be a work of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All you have to do now is add some speech bubbles,<br>and text on the computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you feel that you are missing a scene,<br>just draw it on paper to make a note, and have another photo shoot with the dolls later on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Of course,<br>you don't have to use dolls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But if you use a real kitty cat,<br>you will get scratched.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you have your friends model for you,<br>you will have to pay them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you want something silly and personal,<br>take closeup photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you want an epic comic, you almost don't need models,<br>as your photos would have to capture an enormous background.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In epic photography, a model can be just one-tenth of the scene,<br>but you will of course still need closeups for dialogues.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First you take photographs of your models,<br>then you paint them on canvas with the aid of an art projector.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you take photos of the canvas,<br>this is the process of digitizing your artwork, adding text, publishing be it web or paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can upload it to the internet as a web comic,<br>or start putting together an entire comic book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Give art your love of creating things,<br>and art will give you the inspiration, practice, talent and skill to finish all your works.</div>
