      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Artistic Realism Kind Of Pays The Bills</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Realistically speaking,<br>abstract art will not sell as well as realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your customers are going to be newly wed couples,<br>lonesome strangers with unspeakably magnificent taste...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And fur kids,<br>or rather, fancy pet owners.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hate to say it, but if you just duct tape a <span>banana to a canvas<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>it will probably just spoil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your initial customers will adore your touch,<br>not your marvelously fruity rebellious alchemy of art jazz.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If someone has a room with lots of purple things,<br>a room that their kitty loves for all the sunshine in the morning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will likely say, here is my kitty,<br>and please, make the atmosphere purple.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These are actually two separate things,<br>clearly the kitty will be about realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the purple, is where the kitty is posing from,<br>the atmosphere is the abstract part.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Paint splatter, a purple nebula of textures,<br>or a heart shaped hole in the wall...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That reveals not just the kitty,<br>but the universe it comes from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would call this the balance of realism and the abstract,<br>the kitty is as realistic as it gets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But all the other requests,<br>all the customization are all about the abstract.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Getting paid,<br>aside.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Realism is still very hard to resist,<br>and it may not be a good idea to fight it...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow, at the end of the day realism feels really good,<br>and the more abstract works feel like they could be better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is rarely possible,<br>to change course from surrealism, back to our universe, back to realism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is trivial, nay, it is fun,<br>to get the realism done first, and then build the abstract around it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All I am saying is, that there is inextinguishable fire,<br>in a work with realism at it heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mixing money and art is a terrible thing,<br>that is why we have to divide the two apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We just have to know, right at the beginning,<br>aha, this is a work of art that will pay my bills, $50 bucks is $50 bucks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other end, we can say,<br>aha, this piece, is meant for a gallery, that I hope to exhibit at next year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And perhaps they'll take it along to a bigger show,<br>and this kitty comes with a bigger price tag, $50,000, plus the notepad with sketches set at $75.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This way Art is still pure,<br>but it can also pay bills.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Before you get around to selling art,<br>you will need a consistent portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Due to issues of copyright and fair use,<br>which even <span>got the artist behind the Obama HOPE poster in hot water<sup>[2]</sup></span>, you must choose carefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I recommend that you settle on nine realistic portraits,<br>with a consistent abstract finish or twist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your portfolio,<br>is just a website with those nine works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need a dot com name, which is about $12 per year,<br>this will allow you to switch services.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can redirect to dribbble first, then setup a proper website,<br>and then move somewhere else without anybody holding that name hostage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When setting up accounts on websites that offer custom portraits,<br>I think you will find that even before they ask you for your bank details.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will want to see, or glance at,<br>your portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the first step is nine consistent portraits,<br>that will show your customers, and galleries that maybe interested, exactly what to expect.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Reddit Gets Drawn<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>has a fantastic clause in their rules,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"By submitting a photo,<br>submitters are agreeing that artists can distribute and sell work based on the photos uploaded."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only small drawback I can see here is other artists,<br>selling works or holding works in their portfolio based on the same model.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't think that is a big problem,<br>but you can also paint your own selfies, that will be perfectly unique.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Other than Etsy, I don't have any specific recommendations where to sell,<br>but <span>I recommend searching the web<sup>[4]</sup></span> to discover new locations with better deals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is important to grasp the gravity of selling custom digital portraits,<br>these are products that are held in high esteem, perfectly personalized, that never need upgrades, recompilation, or security fixes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Selling custom portraits online is superior,<br>to spending days writing custom code that demands frequent maintenance, and occasional security audits.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And of course,<br>Art is in a universe of its own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is,<br>one of Humanity's most wonderful traditions.</div>
