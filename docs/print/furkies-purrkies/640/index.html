      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Why Math?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once pressured for long enough,<br>students will ask why they need trigonometry if they will never use it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a student to think that math is useless,<br>is to have already been tricked and convinced that they are not smart enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Math is taught so wrong,<br>that children often ask why do I need this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Smartphone aside, in their madness teachers respond that,<br>"You won't always have a calculator."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Often cunningly, many teachers will attempt to dominate a class,<br>by pretending to have a short fuse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will be taking the shortest path possible,<br>they just want to get paid, put some food on their table and move on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They know their material does not benefit students,<br>It only benefits the test at the end, the finals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The content that finals attempt to test is a mess,<br>it is garbage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Students in their sanity,<br>know that it is safer to memorize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What they memorize,<br>is certain to be on the test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike the things,<br>that they would like to focus on and explore further.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they tried to learn the mix of concepts for real,<br>then they would fail the finals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The class is not about teaching,<br>it is just about passing the tests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The students know this very well,<br>that is why many just don't care about school or grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a world of fake teachers, liars, pretenders, bullies,<br>and fake education constantly grading the student down...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Alcohol and Fighting, Hating and Anger,<br>Revenge and Blind Stupidity, start to make sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once parents start punishing the so called bad students,<br>parents become part of the system that is seemingly attacking them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One horrible thing about grades,<br>other than the fact that they are unethical, toxic and insane.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is that once a person starts getting Cs.<br>they will keep getting Cs from all the other incompetent teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers base their grades,<br>on all the grades in other classes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you are a C student in all the other classes,<br>but do really well in your favorite one, you are not going to get straight A's.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">To do mathematics justice,<br><span>start with simple programming tutorial<sup>[1]</sup></span>, <span>and move on to a more free hand language<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the <span>design and create screen savers, including 3D screen saves<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br><span>and pixel-art games<sup>[4]</sup></span>, at least at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Screen savers are not an outdated invention,<br>all the sci-fi screens in movies are basically screen savers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Computer games and graphics create a context,<br>a reason for learning math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Games and graphics are flexible enough,<br>to capture curiosity of all students so as long as they explore what calls to them.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason schools are broken,<br>is that there is no pressure to fix them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is plenty of pressure to increase the GPA,<br>but nobody cares that Mathematics is learned in a Screen Saver class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody cares to think about it,<br>because it is not their problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Institutions will not check schools based on Screen Saver abilities,<br>there is a top down division of subjects and that is what keeps the schools in business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Over time, everything has gravitated towards memorization,<br>which is acting, a way to pretend to know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Multiplication table and order of operations,<br>is not an argument for memorization, order of operations or or trigonometric functions need to be understood.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Forcing memorization SOHCAHTOA, is not real education and it is harmful and crazy<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br><span>the students need to understand it for real and in a real setting of a computer game or a screen saver<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being tricked into memorization and graduation without ever using trigonometry is fraud,<br>there is no excuse for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The wrong division of subjects,<br>that eliminates real world application in favor of abstract garbage...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The forcing students into memorization,<br>by tricking them into thinking that they are the ones that made the choice not to understand...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fraud of grades, manipulating them to stay under the radar,<br>to keep the teaching job, to keep the school funded...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parents punishing their children, for not behaving properly in a mad house and a meat processing plant,<br>that cheats them out of real knowledge for the purpose of small paychecks...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is quite a gamble to make,<br>as far as the future of human kind the students that are failing fake educations are certainly not the dunces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And make no mistake,<br>silence of principals, teachers, and parents, is the same as participation, all parties involved are guilty of fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All students are extremely intelligent,<br>the only thing that can stop them from the mastery of technologies that call to them, are parents and teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a wonder,<br>that the students are listening at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The betrayal of younger generation, that results in their debt,<br>and awful jobs and career choices, that will have extremely negative impact on their mental health, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know the word for what happens to the children that the military recruiter manages to lie to,<br>in great part because they learned nothing in school.</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Real education is not that difficult<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>and it makes a world of difference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If education worked correctly,<br>the graduates would <span>co-found start ups together<sup>[8]</sup></span> as part of a real graduation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than school debt,<br>they would start by inventing new things that they could be proud of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not gamble with the future of Human Kind,<br>let us guide the children to Real Knowledge, Life Changing Wisdom, and the resulting Greatness.</div>
