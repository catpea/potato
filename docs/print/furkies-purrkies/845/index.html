      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Weird Poem About Visual Programming</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a way Visual programming is new,<br>and hardly anyone has a clue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not come with a guarantee,<br>that is the biggest problem I see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of programming,<br>which is a loving, and funny, and wonderfully challenging world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is this huge question,<br>and even a huge-er problem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The question is:<br>"Does your program fix problems that people actually have?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the huge-er problem, is,<br>that everything is broken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Phone are missing functionality, operating systems keep crashing,<br>new products need firmware upgrades...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you are thrifty or cheap,<br><span>hackers have access to a detailed map of your home<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So what does a visual programming language fix?<br>and is it really broken?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The file structure of a program,<br>does not represent what the program does.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visual programming languages,<br>can create maps of the program flow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if we sprinkle in <span>yeoman templates<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>we can eat the cake and have the files properly structured too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is it a problem people have,<br>yeah, programmers have to jump hoops to bridge concepts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is an <span>example of a confusing adapter in Rete.js<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>that is needed to connect an input box to the node in the programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It makes code neat, it makes sense,<br>but it also crushes Rete.js programs under their own weight and non-portable code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is potential here to create a nicer front-end,<br>but unless it comes from the developer then things will get proken pretty soon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A really neat example of pretty code, is Dream Code<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br><span>but the world took a completely different path than this creating even more complexity<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then the pink elephant that nobody talks about,<br>the web is about text, and maybe navigation maps, not really about connecting boxes together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And beyond that you need a team of developers to create a visual programming language in a reasonable stretch of time,<br>and you may need multiple and unique prototypes to get it right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if you request that everything works exactly like Blender's Geometry Nodes,<br>there are no guarantees here, everything is new, and you may end up trying to fix problems that people don't have, anyway.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The web has a wisdom about it self,<br>for one, when a program is written correctly...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In as little as one hour,<br>it will already work on big and small screens.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no guarantee that visual programming on a phone,<br>will be fixing the problems that people actually have.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the screen pinching,<br>and messing around with little wires...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And trying to connect an output of some math node that is literally two feet away on a smartphone,<br>seems like trouble, and quite a development risk to take.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a pretty terrible thing to receive a fully functional program after a some months,<br>and then end up not using it for anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine hiring a team of developers,<br>and the program just can't work on a little screen, or can't really help anybody with anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pink elephant,<br>is a mean creature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The big problem with visual programming,<br>is passing information to nodes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may have a play song or sound node,<br>and then you want the user to pick what sound to play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So the play sound node is just a beautiful square box, neat and simple,<br>and it is part of a reasonably readable chain of actions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example open window, let user pick song, verify something, or make a song purchase,<br>and then you arrive at he play song/sound node and now there is trouble.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because you have to drag something from pick a song node,<br>to play a song node, and after a while you have all these wires everywhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no making the wires of the nodes that are not in the view-port transparent,<br>does not help, because we have a mess here, it is a mess.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We tried to escape from a mess of files,<br>of from the mess of arbitrary GraphQL queries with random data quota, and we just created a mess of wires.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no you can't just group program functions together in to a single node,<br>because the input of that node will still require the wires.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visual Programming the way we have it today,<br>does not yet fix much.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the elephant is not the only animal in the room,<br>I don't know what animal this is, but it has to do with time travel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because a programmer, should be allowed to create a node,<br>in behavior description only.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the visual programming language, will complain,<br>that he program cannot run because this node does not yet exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That the programmer has to create it,<br>and that the created node must pass the behavior test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, we say we want an UPPERCASE node,<br>that makes all the letters upercase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we describe that, the test is to fail until,<br>the word 'cat' (in lowercase) comes out of the node in uppercase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a simple test, and a simple mechanism,<br>that allows the creation of large programs, that are yet to be programmed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There can be a bounty back-end where programmers will get bounties,<br>for programming those nodes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here the developer or a clever company armed with this program,<br>will watch it bubble up into reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least, the programmer will get a decent todo list,<br>and the project lead, perhaps a reasonable time estimate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To add insult to injury,<br>these wire based programs, can sometimes branch creating large trees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here there maybe a large reuse of variables,<br>as the program takes different routes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now we triple, or quintuple,<br>the number of wires.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, trying to fix a quirk that potentially exists on multiple unreadable branches,<br>makes visual programming a real problem, and the whole effort becomes pointless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I just want to throw this one last thing in there,<br>aligning nodes to make them more visually appealing, or to make them go around come cluster of nodes - is a huge waste of time, and quite a distraction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While I continue testing <span>Rete.js<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>and now <span>Dataflow<sup>[7]</sup></span>...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Given the complexity on the visual programming language implementation end,<br>and the potential readability or lost variable issues...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It seem to me that the first principle of Visual Programming,<br>should be Smartphones and Tablets first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here <span>Cytoscape.js<sup>[8]</sup></span> maybe a better visualization library,<br>as it serves as a map and has automated layout, and the library is complete very little programming is required here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once a node which here is more abstract, is clicked,<br>then the smartphone will enter a web-page for that node, perhaps even open it in a new tab.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the operations will be performed by a wizard, or a step by step interface,<br>where if someone is trying to add a new node, the page will just list all the available nodes with just standard web technologies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cytoscape map is a map of flows within the program,<br>they are simple and readable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The node configuration values, all the wires that create an unreadable mess,<br>are replaced with values that are injected into the entire flow control stream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the program is ran, all the unused values are automatically removed,<br>but creating a verbose linter is a great option too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will complain that, "Hey, you have a song name in the flow control stream,<br>but the last time you used it was in the play node, do you want me to remove it from the stream at that point?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, does this fix a problem that people actually have,<br>yes, it shows the flow control of programs graphically.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And allows even the novice user, to inject variables into the stream,<br>such as email by asking "What is your email Address".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then it allows to use that value later on in the flow control stream,<br>or branching streams, in an alert when computer running out of disk-space or when water detected in the basement node.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here there is room for a node to suggest to the user what it needs,<br>and perhaps even go as far as to offer injecting an input node that asks for email.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Visual Programming is a great idea,<br>but this does not mean, we need to create visual nodes with little input boxes and property sockets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though it does require that we need to think in streams or flows, and nodes,<br>so that the end result is just bunch of easy to comprehend boxes (or nodes) connected together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visual Programming just means,<br>that we have to help the user see how the entire program flows.</div>
