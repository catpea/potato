    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">During my first and last internship,<br>a brainless CEO walked up to me and asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who do you want to be?<br>what do you want to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While I still had difficulty speaking,<br>I could have answered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But instead,<br>I mumbled something about cutting paper.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The woman in control of the internship programme,<br>suspected that I knew perfect English.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And me not communicating back with the CEO,<br>was all the evidence she needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Half way through High School,<br>a strange award ceremony appeared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Kid sitting next to me laughed that he got an award,<br>it was nice, but dishonest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yup, as you can guess,<br>I was one of the few people that did not get an award.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometime before the ceremony I brainlessly read some Shakespeare,<br>which I later dismissed, as it was not a good way to learn English.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And I am with Mr. Vonnegut on the quality of Shakespeare's stories<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>I think he was capable of more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even before that, I was asked to give my opinion on new teacher hires,<br>I used the residual dictionary from the ongoing conversations in the room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even I noticed how well I worded myself,<br>but in her eyes this did me no favors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was right about the new teacher not being a good fit,<br>but deep down I wished her all the luck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So the teacher wasn't aware of residual dictionaries,<br>and relative ease communicating within a preset context.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was going to be taught a lesson by not receiving,<br>a fake award for fake progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My scrambled reply to the CEO was rooted in the way he treated me,<br>the truth was he didn't deserve a response.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was already familiar with DOS, <span>GEOS<sup>[2]</sup></span>, Mac OS, Windows 3, and maybe Win95,<br>and could program a couple of flavors of BASIC.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was told not to enter the software library room,<br>and my knowledge of commuters was ignored.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I could have learned <span>HyperCard and HyperTalk<sup>[3]</sup></span> in a week flat,<br>I could have learned image editing, very quickly too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead my computers skills were used to copy a phone book,<br>from paper to a Mac OS, it was awful, and it was boring.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I felt forced to remain silent,<br>as I could have gotten kicked off the internship.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students were forced,<br>to participate in for a grade.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then I got to clean the printers,<br>and clean dust off of shelves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The CEO approached me,<br>as I was cutting paper to size.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The question of "What do you want to do [in life]?",<br>seemed genuine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But during an unpaid internship,<br>the first thing that a CEO has to do is pay the interns, at least minimum wage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And minimum wage would not impress me,<br>I'd see it as a formality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He had several free workers,<br>and acted like he was doing <strong>us</strong> a favor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We were forced to be there to get a passing grade,<br>and he was getting free labor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And those who kissed his ass were promised a job,<br>though the company did not have any paid High School kids as employees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That promise might have been tied to graduating High School,<br>this was not an new company, and companies like that last ten years on average.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was an enormous gap between what a High School student knew about computers,<br>and what was needed, to be useful at an advertising agency.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember trying to explain to one of the smartest and classiest students,<br>that she needs to close the shape she drew on the screen before she tried to use the fill tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the only time that a person looked at me with disgust,<br>and she also convinced her friend to look at me with disgust too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I myself remember being surprised that the bucket always filled my screen,<br>this was some years back on a Commodore 64, and I quickly figured it out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I told the internship programme manager,<br>that I am cleaning office, and I need to transfer out of the internship.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up tidying things up in the High School office,<br>but there was nothing meaningful to learn there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if there was a HyperCard and modern Graphic Design class without pre-requisite,<br>all that would represent in the High School context is a threat to my GPA.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The message is simple, no graduation no job,<br>and any advanced classes pose a threat to graduation especially for someone who is still learning English.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The safe route is to learn at home eliminating all the risks,<br>and then take the class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a small number of subjects this is reasonable,<br>but in my context the price of the Apple Computer, and the necessary software was out of this world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I later had a Pentium 90, with a $360, 1GB hard drive,<br>but I needed and Apple, two commuters, and that was not possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of good ideas only turn out to be just 10% or less of the whole,<br>the teachers were 10%, the award ceremonies were 10%, the internship was 10%.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And everyone involved gets away with it,<br>they get away with not doing 90% of their job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They only do enough to look like they are working,<br>the award ceremonies and graduations are basically fake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, my GPA didn't even matter, as I dropped out of High School,<br>as when the teacher says that "Weed In An Herb", you get up and leave.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That kind of thing is only the tip of the iceberg,<br>and I was right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Later I got scooped up to get my diploma from Adult Ed,<br>graduating six months early with extra credits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But at this point, I felt that the Principals knew,<br>that failing to get a diploma from their dog and pony shows, actually ruins lives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it actually felt like it was less pretending and more learning,<br>but one would expect that from Adult Ed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not how schools are meant to work,<br>in fact they appear to be interfering with real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because you can't learn for real, in your own way, in your own sequence, at your own pace,<br>you have to do cookie cutter text book stuff, which is just one of a dozen if not a hundred ways of learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the truth comes out when it comes to programming languages,<br>as real results are required.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When learning math on paper,<br>it is all abstract, and any Joe Slick can just preted to teach it by following a lecture program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, I needed to be learning HyperCard in a class that does not threaten my diploma,<br>and later free classes where I could learn more about programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The local College was charging $500 dollars,<br>for a basic VisualBasic 6 class where I already figure everything out on my own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember teacher looking at me to see if some of the things he said were correct,<br>he learned from a book, he might not have been writing any programs at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also learned Java before taking Java,<br>which took 20 some hours coming from ActionScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I got a 99 on the final, because the test was actively trying to trick students,<br>being focused on a perfect score I messed up one mangled obscure question.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have no choice but to learn on our own,<br><span>the schools are not quite interested in actually teaching us<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The GPA must never get in the way of real education,<br>and that can only mean self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The schools work in such a way that it is better to learn first,<br>and then take the classes for a diploma.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by learning, I don't mean reviewing the text books that the Java class uses for example,<br>I mean mastering the programming language on your own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Writing some programs, publishing couple of Android Apps to really soak up the language,<br>and then taking the class, and using real knowledge to overpower the nonsense of the class, text book and the test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In many situation that means asking if Organized Education is worth the trouble and the debt,<br>if the alternative of becoming an Entrepreneur and continuing to self educate with multiple little side projects and start-ups in not the wiser choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is absolutely the most important thing in the world,<br>without it we will be making decisions based on wrong information.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think the urgency of coherent powerful self education,<br>is such that the question of organized education is more about entertainment; isn't that what a Dog And Pony show is?</div>
