    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Art has finally forced me to rest a little while,<br>I still did a quarter of a realistic painting today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A realistic continuation of the Lady and Her Dog,<br>but at a much slower pace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Using Reference Images Tool,<br>as a tracing and color guide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By stretching it over the entire Krita canvas,<br>aka Cat Pea Technique, is an incredible teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, over it, not next to it,<br>when you set the reference to 1% opacity, your color picker will still grab the correct colors from the reference photo.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I use a 15 inch by 15 inch 300 dpi canvas,<br>I work zoomed in so far, that I can see pixels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It never really feels like tracing,<br>because you are always working with layers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In no time, you will break down the nose,<br>into bottom shadows on one layer, and the nose-dome on the top layer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are building up knowledge of the face,<br>without any concern - at all - that you will somehow get stuck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your reference image, will teach and protect you,<br>it will inspire you to create works that would make the younger you pause in disbelief.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you are working with a wall projector in a physical world,<br>you are always adjusting things, and shimmy shammying...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and trying not to get paint on you,<br>in the twilight of your studio, which is to say room or basement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the computer, you get to focus on learning a bit more,<br>and everything you do here, translates perfectly to the real canvas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For one, you need your reference images in the physical world too,<br>and you need a huge pane of glass over them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That glass surface is where you will need to mix,<br>or at least test your colors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasy art, where you paint faces by just following a system you memorized, is great,<br>but realism demands far more, especially when you paint on a real canvas in the physical world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need the colors on a glass pane,<br>and you need shape reference in the form of a projector.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you need to keep your image in a Photo Editing program like GIMP,<br>where you can have multiple layers, some for outlines, others for highlights.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, projecting shadows, on a canvas that you already painted to some degree,<br>isn't going to be very useful, as the projected image is dark in-that area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to invert the colors,<br>so that the wall projector is emitting light in the area where the shadows go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of this reduced to a much simpler environment,<br>here in the Open Source Krita.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And,<br>thee simpler your setup...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the faster,<br>you master.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But asking which canvas is superior, the real physical one or the virtual computer one,<br>is a silly question - there are no reasonable answers here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You learn faster on the computer, and the canvas won't cost you $50.<br>is about all you can say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And please remember to purchase an inexpensive $40 dollar Pen and Tablet for your computer,<br>the tip of the pen is a pressure sensor that will allow you to gently paint in semitransparent layers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One extremely important lesson, a source of regret for many artists,<br>is not making a time-lapse video of the creation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just get a cheap camera with a time-lapse feature,<br>and put it in the corner somewhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In Krita enable the Reorder Docker,<br>play around with the settings, and hit record, maybe enable automatic recording too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am working to create new more realistic portraits on top of,<br>a lowbrow version that I already published, this will make an interesting five minute move about the transition from surrealism to realism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, the hard pursuit of Artistic Realism under Krita,<br>will give you a solid art education in less than three weeks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may end up with as many as ten fine portfolio pieces,<br>merely as part of your self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By tracing under Krita,<br>you instantly become an artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you get to the point where you are building scenes from the photographs yo took,<br>and arranging them in GIMP before setting them up as reference under Krita.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will discover, and I promise you this,<br>that it is not tracing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will find that what you thought of as tracing,<br>was True Art, all along.</div>
