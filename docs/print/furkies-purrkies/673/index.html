  <div class="paragraph">In the morning I came up with this beauuuuutiful idea for the video book chapter,<br>and it was one of those branching chapters full of colors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I got out of my bed,<br>ready to start my day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And oh my gosh,<br>it turned out, my amazing idea; was just an empty dream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I dreamt up a beautiful chapter,<br>without actually knowing what that chapter was about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thanks,<br>dreams.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">On my way back upstairs,<br>to dream up the video chapter for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I walked by my bicycle,<br>and briefly pondered a missing screw in my mud guard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It actually shipped that way,<br>as a result my rear fender wobbles left to right like a tail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been like this for over a year,<br>I just don't have the right screws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have a light beneath here,<br>and it is kind of important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One step...<br>one step after that, I froze with a mechanic's grin.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I flew upstairs to get my electronic digital calipers,<br>and started measuring the screw I did have.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I took measurements of the mount holes in my fender,<br>and wrote it all down with my tongue slightly sticking out to the side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Happy with all the information I gathered,<br>I begun MODELING THE SCREW in blender for 3D printing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is built in add-on for making bolts,<br>but I still needed to get the dimensions perfectly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I ended up creating two versions,<br>the second screw version has a slot for a quarter to use as a screw driver.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first version was a scary perfect fit,<br>but the second crossed the line of perfection, into who knows what.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I made sure to document my development,<br>so that I could do a little poetic write up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what is harder to believe for me,<br>how much fun I had... or that I can fabricate perfect screws at the tip of a hat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I probably shouldn't say this,<br>but I will spend the entire Spring admiring those screws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And of course,<br>after I fixed my fender.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I crossed my arms, lifted my head,<br>and looked down at the over-fourteen little things I can print out to trick out bicycle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think my favorite is a cheap little headlamp holder,<br>that I can slide into my handlebar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I ever ride at night,<br>I can blink at drivers left and right of me straight from the handlebar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think the first thing I'll design,<br>is a sophisticated little noisemaker that will make a motorcycle sound with the spokes of my wheels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Loud pipes,<br>save lives.</div>
