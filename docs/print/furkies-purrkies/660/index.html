    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Among many other curious things,<br>you develop, a Fossil Fancy, at Nordhouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because after a couple of weeks,<br>it feels like you did it all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are never bored, but Nordhouse is always so interesting,<br>that you are always searching for more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter what it is that you are searching for,<br>you are bound to find a fossil of some ancient plant.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when fossil finding becomes second nature,<br>you search for alternate activities.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I once scientifically remembered that yelling obscenities,<br>eases pain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So one morning when the water was still cold,<br>I decided to test that strange theory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I guess... it works,<br>I chose that four letter word.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That Simon and Garfunkel once referred to as,<br>"<span>The Old Familiar Suggestion<sup>[1]</sup></span>"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Come to think of it,<br>I was going to yell it anyways because of how cold the water was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I probably found some fossils,<br>on my way back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another time I set off on a long adventure,<br>to check if I could see <span>The Big Sable Lighthouse<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As far as the beach goes,<br>the lighthouse is the northern most feature of the state park.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you head south from Nordhouse,<br>it maybe possible to see it, or so I thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it was too far to see,<br>though I half remember mist being in the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On my way back,<br>I started searching for a nice place to sit and rest a bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I discovered this strange dry cove,<br>with hundreds of exposed rocks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It quickly became my prime fossil hunting spot,<br>I'd set off in the morning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And by noon,<br>have a lite baggy of strange and mysterious rocks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there was never an end to interesting things,<br>funny seagulls and somewhat frightening frogs would always come by for a photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Occasionally I'd stumble upon some driftwood,<br>I'd build horses out of the little bit and paint the big ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once I started taking photos of all the sunsets,<br>which are very beautiful at Lake Michigan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if there was nothing going on on the beach,<br>the ancient forest was just a hop away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out Acorns and Mushrooms<br>are very photogenic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once I found all the fossils I could carry,<br>I begun searching for arrowheads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think thousands of people tried that exercise before me,<br>so I started just searching for rocks that just looked like arrowheads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I found,<br>two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of time to think about Life and Nature at Nordhouse,<br>and call of the wild, is absolutley real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You begin wondering about walking the long trails,<br><span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>Continental Divide Trail<sup>[4]</sup></span>, and the <span>Pacific Crest Trail<sup>[5]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think there are many hidden adventurers,<br>that would find those trails to be <span>great medicine, and great health<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would always return from my adventures,<br>and with a notebook full of programming and art ideas, and get coding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though one time, I enjoyed the beach sand in my car so much,<br>that I just didn't want to get rid of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few days later,<br>I cheerfully drove back to Nordhouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And got some more fossils,<br>to add to my collection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a double vacation,<br>I guess.</div>
