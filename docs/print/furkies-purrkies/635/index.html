    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful as broken people may try to trick you,<br>into becoming other than you really are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The longer they have you in their grasp,<br>the harder it will be to divide who you are and who they want you to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are really powerful,<br>and always work to ensure we are one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you are tricked into doing something<br>your mind may make it look like it is who you are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to carefully go back in your imagination,<br>and divide what you really would have done from what you were made to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Adults go though their entire lives,<br>blaming themselves for things they were tricked into doing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So this is very serious business,<br>we have to carefully examine who we are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Assuming that the things you did while being manipulated, are our own,<br>is a service for the bad people that tricked you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They won't teach you this in school,<br>and many young people are constantly lied to so that they are more obedient.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But growing up, and decision making, requires wisdom, truth, and authenticity,<br>you don't want to become an adult who regrets their past.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The grades in school are a lie for example,<br>grades have nothing to do with your intelligence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not even learning for real,<br>everyone is just temporarily memorizing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even suspecting that this is true,<br>many people will go through their entire lives thinking of themselves as a C student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please know that it is not possible to get a real education from a standardized curriculum,<br>because everyone learns differently and at a different speed, and in a unique sequence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing you can do in a standardized sequence and time period,<br>is memorize and pretend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember this,<br>remember not to judge your intelligence by the fake grades you get in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Worse than grades are pretenders,<br>which by definition are liars as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than trying to become one of the popular kids,<br>become you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because if you just pretend to be cool like pretenders do,<br>be it memorizing tests and becoming teachers pets, or maybe, laughing at others, or worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you don't really know yourself,<br>all you will become is the whim of the group you follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of bullies have their start in such a thing,<br>they become a bully as not to be bullied, that is a terrible thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The harm they cause by their own hand,<br>may just be inseparable from who they are even if they are tricked or want to be one of the popular kids.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But don't worry, you are not going to become an outcast,<br>as pretending to be cool is not the same as being cool, they are not the real cool kids.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people you were looking to befriend are actually legendary,<br>and they are mostly found in stories, or videos; in narrated books and documentaries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the way you join their group is by taking to narrated books,<br>and by becoming a dreamer and a thinker capable of original thought beyond merely following others.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thought by though, will become knowledge and wisdom,<br>you will become a writer as you chronicle your journeys, and maybe come your wisest age a Philosopher or a Great Being.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will be hard to mark the beginning of your journey,<br>but narrated books about adventure and growing up are a powerful way to leap forward in your development.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow older nobody will care that you used to hang out with the popular kids,<br>people will care about your Wisdom, your Adventures, your Pursuits; the stories you tell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What really matters is your Originality,<br>and the paths you took along the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>Never</strong> follow, be it the more traveled by path or the grassy one,<br>avoid it, completely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make your won way through life,<br>so that at each age, you are always you, and all your lessons are connected in a way that you can understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Know that when it comes to real education,<br>you are always always learning, reading or listening to new books, and there is no graduation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to adventure, take to knowledge,<br>take to wisdom, and if it calls to you, take to greatness too.</div>
