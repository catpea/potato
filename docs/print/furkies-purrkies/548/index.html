  <div class="paragraph">You know that scene in 1989 Batman, where he grabs Vicki Vale,<br>points what looks like a weapon at Joker, presses the trigger, the weapon does something utterly useless,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then as they fly out the door with Ms. Vale fake screaming...<br>the unhinged Joker goes: "Where does he get these wonderful toys?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To answer the question,<br>he designs them himself.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Useless and strange functionality,<br>like a red button, in the sea of yellow, lies at the heart, of actually owning something for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is my vision of a reasonable wallet,<br>it comes with a dangerous looking button.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That upon a press, extends its wings,<br>the wings just happen to hold the bolts of the locking mechanism.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am happy with a 3D printed plastic version,<br>but it is possible to print it as wax, and then cast it in Aluminum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless you design something yourself,<br>the true owners are the Artists, Designers, and Engineers that created it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Pink Elephant in the Industrial Design room,<br>is the fact that people can only own copies of the product.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Not only should we own 3D printers, desktop laser cutters and milling machines,<br>but we also need to learn the software.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing more fascinating than learning how to build a hinge for your Purse or Wallet,<br>plus it maybe something that people who just like knickknacks, maybe interested in purchasing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not to mention building your favorite gadgets inside out, at sub millimeter precision scale,<br>and spending a whole half hour examining the magnificence of your first mechanical device - yikes!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">3D printers are not just about printing other people's designs from the internet,<br>but creating your own, so that you can actually truly own them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You know how you go to a museum,<br>and you don't really know what style, or period, or even type of thing you are into?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you start designing your own products, you will snap into your own style, period, type, genre, and every other category there is,<br>your own designs, are your reference point, to every other piece of art - to your own class and style.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am not much of a car person, precisely because the only people that can really own a car,<br>are the Artists and Engineers that made it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But for the first time in my life, I clicked on Automania over at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,<br>I've3 been staring at the 1960 Airstream Bambi Travel Trailer, deeply unhappy about the square windows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>My goodness, can you imagine the Bambi with with beautiful Yacht-like portholes<sup>[1]</sup></span>, what a piece of art that would be,<br>I wouldn't have noticed the atrocity, if I wasn't examining the fancy round corners for my own product designs.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And High School, where individuality and originality still maters, thank goodness,<br>once the Highschoolers figure out how easy it is to become an Industrial Product Designers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will realize that Maclemore, was actually warning them in his <span>Thrift Shop song<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>that paying extra for other peoples designs, is just getting tricked by a business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blender modeling tutorials and 3D printers, are not only essential for a Highschooler,<br>they are critical, because that is the difference between getting tricked and being original - <span>and they are already getting tricked by the crappy education they are getting<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">3D Modeling original creations and printing them out on 3D printers,<br>creates an interesting career path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">High school diploma, and college debt is supposed to lead us to a career,<br>but in the modern age it just takes a few hours of tutorials to get ready to sell things on online.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is possible to just sell 3D models, like a modern <span>armored Batman for $3<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>or printed models like <span>ugly $20 wallets<sup>[5]</sup></span>, or <span>$25 cosplay masks<sup>[6]</sup></span>, or <span>$200 futuristic cannons<sup>[7]</sup></span> with LED lights.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is incredible about this,<br>that nothing needs to be printed until it is actually sold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Online stores often have a number of sales listed,<br>the simple Cosplay mask I was looking at sold 7,913 copies which at $24 comes to $189,912.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe rare to make that much money from 3D printed models,<br>but it is a fine entry point into the world of business - and it certainly makes for powerful daydreams that crush the threat of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I would like to add that creating products is not just about 3D modeling, and 3D printers,<br>it is about learning, and prototyping.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once a person learns the work-flow and prototypes some BASIC models, they can then pay an experienced designer to create something that they completely understand,<br>giving the 3D modeler instructions on the subject of decorations, hinges, even texture - and taking that model to an online store that will do the printing for them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Understanding 3D printing, also marks the comprehension of fabrication, at this point CNC milling machines are a matter of an email to a designer,<br>moving from plastic to metal takes no effort, and here high quality products can be shipped at high prices.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not all products require weeks of assembly, the tinkerers are quite satisfied buying kits that are yet to be assembled,<br>such could be the case with a wallet that comes with a dozen of components and is pure delight to put together with little screw drivers and fancy brass screws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Creating a metallic terminator skeleton kit<sup>[8]</sup></span>, which <span>sells for about $1,000 to $3,000<sup>[9]</sup></span> and probably beyond,<br>can certainly get a company started.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what great joy for a young person would it be to both <span>receive shipments of metal or resin terminator skeleton components for painting and sale<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>and have a small army in the garage for those who wish to have it shipped overnight - mark my words; any expedition into the world of Fabrication is Bee's Knees.</div>
