  <div class="paragraph">You may already have a computer,<br>but that is not good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need a computer for learning,<br>you can get the pre-assembled $100 <span>Raspberry PI 400<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are <span>some extras you can get<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and you will need a cheap $70 monitor, I recommend you get two cheap monitors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or you can get the <span>some assembly required 8GB version<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br><span>Raspberry PI 4<sup>[4]</sup></span> (not 400).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Note to parents: When I was 10 or 12, I got a Commodore 64, that looked similar to the Raspberry PI 400,<br>I wouldn't know how to assemble a Raspberry PI 4, I would need someone else to do it for me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a slow computer, You Tube takes half a minute to load,<br>but that is very good for learning web design and programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Raspberry PI will work too slow,<br>when the programs are written wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a windows computer,<br>windows is a closed source commercial product.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The money culture propagates through the programmers,<br>and programs that are written for windows often cost too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The money culture, misleads the programmers,<br>to places that bring them nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a Linux based computer,<br>it uses the Debian Operating System.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Debian wraps Linux providing commands,<br>a proper graphic environment and ability to run all the programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most important program is the terminal,<br>just as soon as you get the computer setup.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Go to the terminal that you will recognize from hacker scenes in movies,<br>and prepare to write your first program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will join two commands together,<br>that is how you create a new program, by wrapping two commands.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you connect commands,<br>you are connecting two boxes with a wire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most commands have a configuration,<br>for example you can configure the echo command to say hello.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Open up your terminal and say <code>echo hello</code>,<br>and you will see the word hello printed on the screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now we are going to connect it to another command,<br>to make hello upper case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the other command is tr short for translate,<br>it will accept two configuration arguments from you:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What to convert ... to what, so first you will say the lowercase letters a-z,<br>and then the uppercase letters A-Z.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Enter in your terminal: <code>echo hello | tr a-z A-Z</code>,<br>and press enter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just sent the data hello from the echo command,<br>through the tr command, which barfed it to the screen, because it wasn't connected to anything else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you want to say hello world, use double quotes,<br>it would work without it, but only because the echo command loves you, and is trying to be cute.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The convention here is SPACE is a sacred separator of arguments,<br>that is how the terminal command line can understand you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please think of the command line as a graphical program,<br>that has been reduced to text, by a very angry nerd who got tired of clicking a mouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why should you drag a fancy cute wire between two shiny boxes on your screen,<br>named echo and tr, that have a little drop shadow maybe little flowers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you can just enter echo-hello-tr-az-az on the command line,<br>the command line is a reduction of the user interface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a user interface,<br>reduced to its lowest terms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you are programming for a while,<br>the mouse kind of gets in the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just want to keep your hands on your keyboard,<br>so the quickest way to program something is opening up a terminal and typing up a command.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Raspberry PI window, that your terminal is in,<br>is for normal users, and all the cats who like mice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It can be reduced to a power Grrr interface with the <span>i3 tiling window manager<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>but that is something you do later as it would be too overwhelming at first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still, efficiently using i3,<br>is a sign that you are a powerful creator (it can help you get a strange but fun job).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you get bonus points,<br>for using a reduced key mechanical keyboard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I mention this because years into programming,<br>people often regret not having this muscle memory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is not something you should seriously consider at first,<br>but powerful programmer muscle memory, it is something you need to be aware of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is similar to when a pianist plays the piano,<br>the notes is not something they translate anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The notes are in their hands,<br>they come automatically.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Raspberry PI ships with an option to install,<br>Visual Studio Code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've noticed that people already made copies of it to remove Microsoft proprietary stuff,<br>and get rid of their custom open license.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Microsoft has enabled Telemetry by default,<br>so you may wish to disable that, on principle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">VSCode is a very popular editor,<br>but once a true open-source-version fork gains in popularity you should hop onto that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Executing your first command, and poking at a proper code editor,<br>in a little laboratory corner of your room is a big deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to write any programs,<br>just have your code lab ready.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when you feel like you want to test out some things,<br><span>Install Node and create and run your first JavaScript program<sup>[6]</sup></span> and <span>take a look at some JavaScript tutorials<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, whether or not your laboratory is secret,<br>it is always a good idea to practice saying "<span>Deedee get out of my laboratory!<sup>[8]</sup></span>"</div>
