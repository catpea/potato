      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Small Glance At Borders Of Philosophy and Her Daughters, The Sciences</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We learn philosophy layer by layer,<br>first we take what we understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And upon considering that,<br>we are now able to understand a little bit more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some philosophers consider,<br>that we may wish to discard the ladder once we are done using it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even paint a ceiling,<br>beyond-which things are nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ludwig Wittgenstein warns us:<br>“Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is translated as:<br>"Whereof one cannot speak [of things with much sense], thereof one must be silent."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Philosophers construct things,<br>they go too far, or fall short all the time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Socrates who encourages us with:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings,<br>so that you shall come easily-by, what others have labored hard for."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Also adds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do not mind whether the teachers of philosophy are good or bad,<br>but think only of philosophy herself."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the other end of this spectrum,<br>are people whose ideas are so beautiful that they make other scientists say "it lacks clinical grounding".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I really appreciate this short little ladder about growing up that Jane Loevinger created,<br>see "<span>Loevinger's stages of ego development<sup>[1]</sup></span>".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In her last stage she says "learning is understood as unavoidable ... the unattainable is renounced.",<br>I personally think this as beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to consider that schools are not working very well,<br>that scientist maybe spending too much time comparing rats to humans</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things to strive for, inspirations, projections, even daydreaming about philosophers, warriors or superheroes,<br>are really good for us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way I learned to see science, is as a product of philosophy,<br>so if something does not fit Psychology for lack of clinical grounding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is put back into the broader field of Philosophy,<br>if Loevinger's stages of ego development are not compatible with psychology, then it is a Philosophical System.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps one pending the invention of a new field of Psychology,<br>one where rats are not used to model human behavior.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the subject of Philosophy, Socrates goes on to say:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Try and examine her well and truly, and if she be evil seek to turn away all men from her [...];<br>but if she be what I believe that she is,<br>then follow her and serve her, [...] and be of good cheer."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Socrates is so wonderful here,<br>that Will Durant used this quote in his introduction to <span>The Story Of Philosophy<sup>[2]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Tragically, <span>schools do not present philosophy correctly<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>in turn emerging this abomination we call academic philosophy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to get at it, is to start early, and with books and lectures similar in spirit to The Story Of Philosophy by Durant,<br>introduction to personalities and their best ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just listen, taking only that which is useful to us,<br>things that we appreciate and understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are things in Philosophy that are a kind of nonsense for which there may not be time in life,<br>we should always remember Ludwig Wittgenstein and stick to the things that work for us, that are good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, the really interesting thing is that the second time you read or listen to a book or lecture about philosophy,<br>you will get more out of it, as you have integrated, internalized, adopt the things you learned before.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What was previously difficult to grasp,<br>now will seems reasonable, and this process will continue as you internalize more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will close with a thought on Jane Lovenger's work,<br>I think in the distant future as Humanity progresses forward, her work will be recognized as something very useful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Future schools may even use stages of development as a tool used in guiding students forward,<br>showing them where they should be headed to secure World Peace, Human Dignity, and continued Advancement of Human Kind.</div>
