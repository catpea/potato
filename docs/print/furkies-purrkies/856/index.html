      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">GPA Is Sus</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the schools with threats of bad grades, and being held back.<br>And the need to pay for lunch, and pay attention in classes that the students are not interested in - are super weird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And beyond where military is allowed to recruit teenagers,<br>and colleges are allowed to steal all their money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I mean all, because student loans,<br>are taken out of the paychecks later in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tolerance of this mockery of knowledge and wisdom,<br>is causing all kind of harm down the road.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education,<br>the students won’t be able to do anything or real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is so strange to see teachers thinking in their heads,<br>that they use grades to motivate students.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In a real school that is called torture,<br>in part because the fake GPA impacts college and the job or schools afterwards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See you cant even say that, without sounding like a cult member,<br>GPA impact on college and school, is completely made up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Colleges only deny entry to those who didn’t memorize,<br>because they know they will drag the college GPA down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The impact that GPA has on a job, has so many hops,<br>that we might as well be making up a new religion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are so many paths ahead that GPA impact,<br>is just something teachers made up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">None of this is real, the is no way to have a serious discussion about modern schools,<br>without sounding like we are drinking whatever they are hopped up on.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A teacher attempting to torture someone into obedience,<br>by giving them bad grades for something trivial and unimportant, and irrelevant.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something that will never connect anywhere because of cut-up education is,<br>is not just a fabrication, but a delusion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This delusion, in the big picture, is actually cutting them off from their future,<br>for real, cutting them off from food, with all the negativity and interference, and obedience.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the while <span>standardized education simply can’t work<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>because to learn for real we have to gently and cheerfully follow our own curiosity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grades are utterly fake, because teachers trick everyone into cramming,<br>which completely stabilizes their teacher performance score, but makes grades nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Colleges are crazy because everyone knows grades come from cramming,<br>which actually includes puzzle solving, that too is a trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can paint, program, compose, write, rhyme, sing, sculpt, build, and that is proof of knowledge,<br>a test, just pushes out those who won’t perform for a grade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Jobs know that colleges don’t do anything, they grill the students with insulting interviews,<br><span>questions that they themselves only pretend to grasp<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They largely do it to overwhelm and dominate a student,<br>an interview is getting everyone accept the lowest pay possible.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The difference between a person’s natural curiosity about a subject that tickles them,<br>and being threatened by being held back or by getting bad grades is enormous.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Threatening a student into obedience, prevents them from learning,<br>though that means little compared to the fact that the use of standardized curricula...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is a total misunderstanding, or fantasy of education,<br>even if the teacher does break a student into obedience they still can’t learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will not build a coherent picture of a subject,<br>they will only memorize what is going to be on the test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students who would argue this point, simply forget,<br>how much more they would have learned without the interference of school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are in fact self education, but they would do so much better,<br>if their education was about Knowledge, and not the GPA, and chances of getting into brand name schools or jobs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they spent all that time on real education,<br>they would end up launching startups out of high school, vastly multiplying their knowledge by their own hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students know that they are forced into pretending just so that they can get at their future,<br>so that nothing stands in their way, real or not, they want as little interference as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they lose respect for everyone and everything,<br>because they are forced into pretending, so that they can protect their future.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real, is like visiting a new country,<br>you only do the things that you are ready for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And after a while,<br>those things will get you ready to navigate other things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being forced into any path, standardized or randomized,<br>is not education, that is just pushing someone into desperation.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Times are changing, no matter what is in the way,<br>people are getting smarter and smarter, especially students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will soon figure out that to grow up,<br>means to grow all the way up, until they become Great Beings.</div>
