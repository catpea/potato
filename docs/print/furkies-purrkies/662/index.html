      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Incredible Truth About Jogging In Winter</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Across the last two days,<br>I have put in a cautious six miles in 34 and 24 degree Fahrenheit weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am in the middle of a small study of sample of one,<br>testing a crazy simple idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is it better to jog...<br>in Winter, or Summer?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The answer is Winter,<br>it is better to run in winter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">In 2012 <span>Stanford biologists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>were performing some temperature control related experiments on humans.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grahn stated: Your muscle cells are saying, You can't work that hard anymore, because if you do you're going to cook and die.<br>as all Stanford graduates - they invented a gadget.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I took to jogging in winter weather,<br>and <strong>it is</strong> much better than jogging in Summer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In fact, I begun wondering if that free spirited Summer Jogging,<br>may perhaps be a bad idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Couple of years ago I remember wringing out my head bandanna on a summer evening jog,<br>it was completely saturated, and the amount of fluid was troubling.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Jogging in winter still involves sweating,<br>but one is not overheating as badly as on summer evenings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If overheating becomes a problem,<br>you just put one of your clothing layers in your jogging backpack to cool down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In winter, you have access to perfect temperature control,<br>and it is as easy as taking one of your layers of clothing off, or putting one on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wear two pairs of jogging pants,<br>but depending on wind chill it maybe a good idea to put on a pair or long shorts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all wondered why superman wore his underwear on the outside,<br>now it is our chance to do it, and probably get away with it too - if it is the same color as the pants.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And even at 34 degrees weather I wore gloves,<br>gloves are probably a must in colder weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I jog with light dumbbells,<br>so it certainly is a must for me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found that 24 to 34 Fahrenheit weather calls for four layers,<br>a-shirt, t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, with a proper hood that ties with a lace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I wore an athletic breathable long sleeve,<br>if it was warmer, I could put my hoodie away in 34 degree weather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At a windless 34 degrees, I didn't need a hood, of face protection,<br>and I unzipped my hoodie, and it felt great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At 24 degrees Fahrenheit, the hood saved me from cutting today's 4 mile jog short,<br>in addition, due to the wind, I put on a medical mask to warm my face up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a moment during the windy 24 degree jog, when turning around to face the cold wind.<br>I regretted not packing a thin wind breaker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would probably put it on in addition to the hoodie,<br>and 20 degree weather would absolutely call for it - the hoodie alone would not be enough for 20 degree weather.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Jut to clarify and summarize upper body layers that maybe needed for 20 degree weather,<br>a-shirt, t-shirt, thick long sleeve, hoodie, and a wind breaker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In windless 35 degree weather you may not need the hoodie,<br>and won't need the thin wind breaker.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone has a wind breaker, hoodie and a warm shirt,<br>what is missing at least from my wardrobe is a <span>thermal ski mask<sup>[2]</sup></span>, which is extremely important.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ski masks, thankfully have evolved not to look like what robbers wear,<br>wearing shorts on the outside and a bandit ski mask, would probably cross some line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the weather gets any colder, which could be due to wind chill,<br>then <span>ski googles<sup>[3]</sup></span> may also be a good idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The thermal ski mask and cool ski goggles,<br>completely protect the face from the cold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Gloves, long selves, and long pants, ski mask and googles,<br>cover head to toe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have one get a packable (which is to say) <span>lightweight bag<sup>[4]</sup></span> for adapting the layers on the go,<br>phone, wallet, some water, goggles, and other gear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Variable layer that the backpack enables,<br>create ultimate comfort for winter jogging.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">My research continues,<br>as I am waiting for few inches of snow and some slippery ice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I am certain that if you enjoy jogging in the Summer,<br>you will love jogging in the Winter - stay safe.</div>
