    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first thing you are going to need,<br>is to think about a neat place to exhibit <span>your mathematical art<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The next is the frames are important,<br>they are expensive, computer generated art demands perfection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think you should start with a pane of glass,<br>then maybe really thin aluminum rails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I almost feel like you can't cut them with a saw,<br>you will need to make a rough cut an then file them down at a 45 degree angle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You could consider treating your paper with something that makes it tough,<br>and skip glass, just make it flap in the wind, a digital vertical flag.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then there is paper and printer,<br>$100 laser printer could cut it if you had 8x72 paper it would make a nice vertical 6 foot flag.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But go to an office print shop and use their blueprint printer,<br>it uses standard paper, it is black and white laser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You really want to make something physical,<br>a traditional creation that can be made available for maybe $10,000.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think <span>the ideal solution is a plotter<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>this would become your very own and unique brush.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Bare bone plotters are sometimes sold for $150 to $300<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>but they may require a bunch of work, which could be good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, with a plotter you could use multiple color markers,<br>or go for color pencils, even.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which brings us to,<br>creating the graphics that you will print.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't like using the words Math, Trigonometry, even Vector,<br>but Math has been stolen from us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't intentional,<br>it is just that teachers don't know what it is, how to use it, and what it is for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Math is a library of good ideas,<br>perhaps mostly assembled by jittery people that drink way too much coffee.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their creations are abstract,<br>because works of mathematics are best transported or stored, in their most elegant forms.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take a look at videos about <span>E=mc2<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>it is a simple equation, but a complex story, where you have to consider things such as the fact,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That in terms of the universe your weight depends on where you are,<br>therefore you need to use the standardized concept of mass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all you are taught is the formula,<br>without the background - this day and age? - it means your teacher is selling your mind for a paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When they start throwing concepts at you that you covered previously in class,<br>to make you stop questioning the class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They do that, because they know they haven't taught you that either,<br>and can thus use the shame and blame to dismiss you - <span>also, your teacher can't get fired<sup>[5]</sup></span> - <span>they do the dance of the lemons<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't fall for the sweet talk,<br>teaching is not a job, it is a great honor, and a great privilege - it is just that liars liars out compete the honest people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to learn to recognize the fraud,<br>by analyzing the outcomes, by looking at results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By constantly checking,<br>if the class you just took was worth your precious time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And yes I know, to evaluate a class,<br>you need a model, something that you can compare other classes against.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am about to show you,<br>a powerful introduction to Vector math.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These three precious videos will also show you how Math is used,<br>that it requires the confines of a computer program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Math is beautiful, it is not meant for memorization, it is not meant for paper,<br>your math is to be done in a programming environment, where trivialities such as multiplication and formulas, are done <strong>for you</strong> so that <strong>you</strong> can do the real work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here are three classes by by The Nature of Code Channel that I want you to look at:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">1.1 <span>What is a Vector?<sup>[7]</sup></span><br>1.2 <span>Vector Math<sup>[8]</sup></span><br>1.3 <span>Random Vectors<sup>[9]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">This talks about vectors,<br>but this is actually a real introduction to Mathematics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't want to start with scalars,<br>the Golden ration and PI are only that interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You want to start one step away from plain Numbers,<br>where they are applied, where they serve a purpose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These three videos introduce using documentation, they show the ease of object oriented notation,<br>"this." by the way is a way to reference variables and functions that are defined in the object that you are in.<br>(Otherwise the program would think you are referencing normal variables that aren't in the object. Objects are little spherical worlds.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These videos are meant to show you that trivial things are done for you,<br>not just calculations but formulas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Such as multiplying three dimensional vertices,<br>which is useful for programmatically creating 3D objects for 3D printers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They show you real math,<br>what it is, how it is taught, how to use it, and when to use it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here we arrive at that age old question,<br>"Why do I need math?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to be fair to the youngest students,<br>we are only allow to answer this question with a single, perfectly meaningful, and exceptionally powerful word:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Guggenheim<sup>[10]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your works of art, are to be exhibited at Guggenheim,<br>and <span>The Museum of Modern Art<sup>[11]</sup></span> and a few other places, if they are prestigious enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you know who <span>Yayoi Kusama<sup>[12]</sup></span> is?<br>I think of her as the World's Greatest Art Teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, it is her work that does the speaking for her,<br>...we are each an artist - our world depends on it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is time for you to become an artist too,<br><span>start in the beginning<sup>[13]</sup></span>, and when you get to the end, keep the machines going, so that others may follow.</div>
