      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Prototype Five: Superhero Jewelry Box</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I compared my manually modeled work,<br>with the procedurally generated one - and it is superior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all you have to do is move a slider,<br>to go from memory card holder to a jewelry box, then it is superior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are manually modeling, you are working on a sub millimeter scale,<br>to account for clearances of moving parts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bringing all that together is complex,<br>especially since different components need different clearances.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A hinge pin does not need as much clearance,<br>as the hinge units, especially if you are aiming for a friction fit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the re-adjusting that gets you,<br>and here in the bright new world of programming geometry you just slide a slider.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there are problems,<br>and they relate to the material it self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Event mold cast epoxy parts,<br>advertised as made to last, aren’t quite perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And without mentioning sintering,<br>or even casting molten aluminium.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us just address the bigger issue,<br>you are never supposed to print the whole thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just the skeleton that will then hold,<br>whatever materials you need to make your gadget go go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am holding a pre-cut credit card sized piece of<br>sheet metal in my hand right now, and that is the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A thin piece of sheet metal,<br>is very light and extremely durable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this thickness the highly coveted and light aluminum,<br>is basically aluminum foil better meant for a grill.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The price of bits of sheet metal<br>is nothing, and it is already done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t have to print it, cut it, debur it,<br>you just slide it into the skeloton of whatever you are working on...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Click the top of your assembly on, whatever it may be,<br>and a coat of UV resistant paint will make the dodad last forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is the fifth prototype aimed to test a flat large pocket,<br>resembling a jewelry box.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you think about it, a proper vigilante,<br>would not wish to open the top of a pocket like a candy box.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then try to grab whatever is in there,<br>especially if they were in the middle of saving a cat, or fighting an old lady or whatever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But much rather, the side of a pocket,<br>like the side compartments on a bus.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They’d open the compartment with their inner wrist area,<br>and then expose their much needed gadget, to the palm of their hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The gadget would still need,<br>some kind of a simple dispensing mechanism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is easy,<br>say if they needed a jolt of energy...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A candy bar dispenser is a simple inner hinge mounted on the bottom,<br>full height, 1/3 width, it would be pushing the bars into the box.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A superhero belt for sales on the internet,<br>actually demands compartment configuration tutorials.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some of it would show use of elastic bands, or elasticord,<br>which demands loops to be present in the compartment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another great task for procedural 3D object creation,<br>here it is just a flip of a Boolean flag.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And another variation,<br>would have room for mounting plastic assembly blocks like LEGO.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One <span>screen case for Rasperry PI<sup>[1]</sup></span> actually comes with what is described as:<br>“A building block compatible faceplate” they mean LEGO.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I printed the prototype with 1mm wall thickness, I hate to say it again,<br>but setting wall thickness it yet another procedural generation perk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is too thin for PLA,<br>though I did it to save material.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A skeleton case that perhaps accepts thin and shiny acrylic sheets,<br>would call for 3 or more likely 4 or 5 millimeter thickness frame.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The acrylic can be cut at home with a $200 CNC cutter,<br>please don’t even think about using lasers in a $200 machine, just use a normal cutter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lasers are extremely dangerous,<br>and the ones that can go through thin acrylic will damage your sight, don’t try.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Laser,<br>not even freaking once.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is my research into sturdy components,<br>forget about printing the whole thing, Batman would never print the whole darn thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He prints the skeleton,<br>and then slides in the faces and possibly even side walls.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you go with sheet metal,<br>the shiny metallic mirror like surface looks fierce be it belt or armor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you are creating cosplay armor,<br>consider sliding in some ceramic tiles for the chest place - Batsuit can stop a .50 BMG.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I think the last thing I want to mention is,<br>pricing and trademarks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">3D models as in digital files,<br>sell for $15.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Belts that you assemble and paint at home,<br>may sell for $100 or $350 dollars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Think of the belt as a piece of art,<br>each belt is unique, even if you aim to sell under a singe superhero name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just do it the way iron man does it,<br>where the character has multiple suits from MARK I, MARK II, MARK III on up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The advice I would give here is simple,<br>sell both, the digital version for printing and one that you print and assemble your self.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The assembly is somewhat optional is you sell a parts kit,<br>where the person is yet to configure their own version of the belt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here you will need to include the sheet metal or plexy glass components as well,<br>and what a fun thing to play with that is, and that could probably sell for $50 or more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to the trademark, you need to come up with your won names,<br>and as you are about to witness, this can quickly become a disaster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure you are NOT allowed to sell anything named Bat-suit, Bat-belt, or Batman,<br>as those are likely registered trademarks, though I am just a Doctor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Honorary title,<br>as I tent to make people feel better)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I highly recommend you don’t test bored out of their skull powerful corporation lawyers,<br>with bat person, bat thing, or bat-erry, thought battery is probably too generic.. never mind...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Point is you come up with a name that you can put a dot com after,<br>as that is a super smart person’s trademark search.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By the way supersmartperson dot com,<br>was registered ten years ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever you do, for the love of all things mighty,<br>don’t put pea as in pea in your superhero name.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People will never associate that with the super healthy vegetable,<br>that is the source of your powers, it is the other pea they will think of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though having said that,<br>while peaman dot com was registered in 2011.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Peawoman dot com, at least according to my whois database,<br>has not yet been registered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But please don’t use that as a superhero name,<br>brand name or your product name.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you register PEE woman dot com,<br>which is also available.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then remember you will need to explain to your investors, or parents,<br>the nature of your company name, or hero name, or. their. ailment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anywho the superpowers of a pea woman or a PEE woman,<br>are too powerful and confusing, to reliably sell a belt or armor product on ebay with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And for completion sake, the sidebar of my whois lookup,<br>claims that tinkleman dot live is availabe too, but I am unwilling to investigate any further.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stay away from these terrible superheroes and their awful powers,<br>think happy thoughts, or atleast <span>cat species<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lynxwoman dot com, or asparagusman dot com<br>appears to be available, maybe try that.</div>
