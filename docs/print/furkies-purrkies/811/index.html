  <div class="paragraph">It turned out that the printer required for printing wax,<br>that then can be surrounded by a casting medium (plaster)...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fired in an oven to remove wax,<br>and filled with molten metal such as Pewter or Silver, or even Gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Costs a bit less than a regular 3D printer,<br>such as <span>Ender 3 v2<sup>[1]</sup></span> (<span>which you should always get with a Bed Leveling Kit<sup>[2]</sup></span>)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wax printer costs about $200 dollars,<br>and is called <span>Mars Elegoo<sup>[3]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a resin printer, breathing resin is dangerous,<br>so you will need ventilation and a mask that can stop the toxic particles.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Melting metal is dangerous,<br>when molten metal traps moisture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moisture will convert to steam,<br>and that means it will rapidly expand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Guess how many times,<br>1,700, and I have a vague recollection of someone saying over 2,000.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So molten metal then pops,<br>and scatters all over the area.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I repeat melting metal is dangerous,<br>I will not do it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But and above all,<br>having a wax part, is a amazing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because you should be able to find a place,<br>that will cast it for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to return to the dangerous side of things,<br>a metal called Pewter which used to be used for spoons in the Colonial era.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Actually to this day you can metal detect spoon bowls,<br>the handles usually snap off as pewter is not as strong as other metals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Pewter is special because it does not require high heat<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>in fact it can be melted in a solder hot plate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be aware that Pewter from an unknown source may contain lead,<br>and led is a deadly neurotoxin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you are going to melt pewter,<br>make sure that it is from a reliable source and certified not to have lead it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But please be safe, gloves, ventilation,<br>and and a face shield are a must.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Again, personally I will never take the risk,<br>Huge Pussies live long for just that reason.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Now, there is something that isnâ€™t dangerous,<br>that is really cool, and fun and fancy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is using a standard <span>PLA plastic<sup>[5]</sup></span> printer,<br>with <span>shiny, silky metallic-looking plastic<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>To get it even more shiny, you can try a vapor smoothing treatment<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>which does require ventilation, but is not as dangerous as metal.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Best way to sell metal jewelry,<br>is by going through a local Jeweler that can cast your creations for a fair price.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But printing plastic Jewelry is also amazing,<br>it is light, inexpensive, and safe to print out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Simply create jewelry that is impossible to cast in metal<sup>[8]</sup></span>,<br>and it will become even more special than gold.</div>
