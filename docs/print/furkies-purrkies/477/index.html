    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a rule that is not as popular as it should be,<br>I call it the 45 minute rule!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Basically, the 45 minute marker,<br>divides adventure from expedition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, before I carry on,<br>allow me to admit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That I was in deed the child,<br>that would eat the tasty sandwiches...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The moment he quit fidgeting and settled in,<br>in the bus, that didn't even leave the parking lot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let me further clarify,<br>that these were real sandwiches.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes they didn't even use butter,<br>but, like, rotisserie chicken thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it would not always be ham,<br>often it was a large sausage called: <span>Oławska Kiełbasa<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And sometimes little bits of said chicken,<br>cooked to perfection, of course.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are talking here about,<br>high end culinary creations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Chicken recipes passed down <em>through generations</em>,<br>and there was always this special spice that accompanied the poor chicken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And before I go on,<br>I wan to say that when New York's <span>El Blizzardo<sup>[2]</sup></span> hit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I saw the snow, I was there,<br>people were building igloos and all that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, I wasn't <em>mindful</em> of expeditions and adventures even,<br>and tragically my time during El Blizzardo was merely few days off and then crawling back to school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In my defense, I quietly assumed that El Blizardos happen every other year,<br>or so.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What I am saying is that we need to <em>develop a nose</em> for Expeditions and Adventures,<br>and thankfully it has never been simpler to take photos, and do take a lot of them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What I should have done, was to walk,<br>or attempt to tunnel with all the other maniacs across the Brooklyn Bridge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps I would have made it to see Dave in person that night,<br>they were apparently not paying enough for people to show up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mostly though I was a Coco fan,<br>goodness knows he needed at least one audience member back then.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for once,<br>it actually helped, that I didn't speak a word of English (<em>rimshot</em>).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unfunny comedians aside, the lesson was learned,<br>know when an adventure begins, always be ready.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And know when an adventure becomes an expedition,<br>make sure to take plenty of water, and silly photos.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">These things happen once a decade,<br>and my goodness, each decade will be better than the previous.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">El Blizzardo went down in 1996,<br>by 2006 the end of my first decade, I've had the great pleasure of finishing to learn Engrish, and retiring as a programmer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By 2016, the end of my second decade, not only did I finish reading my first thousand books,<br>but I slowly begun discovering, that unbelievably, I had something to say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while it is true that 2026 has not arrived yet,<br>I will have surely cursed the world with the completion of my first Audio Book by then.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is really important for all of us to create funny and long winded narrations,<br>it is good for the spirit, it works great across time, and it is not even that hard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The thing about Audio Books is not that they require extra time,<br>bur rather, that it requires many years, to make a good Audio Book, as many as you can spare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while a good paperback should me be more than a hundred pages,<br>a good and interesting Audio Book, should be 50, or 100, or even 500 hours long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As many years as you are willing to spare,<br>and you will never regret it, especially if you manage to share <em>all</em> the wisdom of that particular age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All else fails, just tell them this come your final chapter:<br>"Hey, if you can sit through my book - you can sit through anything." - and that counts for something.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Never miss an expedition, because an expedition comes from almost the same place,<br>that you curiosities do - and I bet you never thought about it that way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a great adventure, or a 45 minute <strong>plus</strong> expedition,<br>the moment it comes to a close, you won't just be better for it, you will be <strong>Greater</strong> for it (and I mean the word in a Philosophical sense)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all fun and games,<br>until you find yourself becoming a Greater, and Greater Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I bet you never thought about this too:<br>"What exactly is the point of an expedition?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are so deeply familiar with the answer to the Expedition question,<br>that it almost sounds circular when you say it: "The point of an expedition is Greatness."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though it may seem like walking to the Supermarket for a change,<br>is no big deal, it is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because it is the time you spend,<br>with the most important thoughts, how lucky you are, how young, or wise, or out of control, or all of the above.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All that it takes to set off on great adventures,<br>is leaving the car keys at home; and a good pair of walking shoes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look around,<br>You are surrounded by Adventures and Expeditions.</div>
