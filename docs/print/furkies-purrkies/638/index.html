    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is still our best invention,<br>and it is the only road to problem prevention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have people who refuse to wear a mask<br>and get angry at those who fulfill that task.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Others say un-vaccinated shouldn't get a place at a hospital,<br>but both are losing their minds little by little.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are like this because of the culture they were raised in,<br>lack of wisdom is how all these troubles begin.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Politicians, leaders, principals, teachers, parent are all at fault,<br>without wisdom the world will run in circles without result.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are multiple plans in place across the world,<br>but things won't work even if everyone does what they are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because there is scarcely a leader that has become wise,<br>as greatness is still a rare prize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing that will help humanity grow,<br>is wisdom, and we have learned this long ago.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If problems are not prevented,<br>then liars will destroy everything precious we invented.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Corrupting education is the oldest trick invented by naves,<br>it is how people are tricked into becoming slaves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A corrupt education is one that only makes us think we learn and know,<br>but at its core it is just for the show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education is a powerful theatrical game,<br>even knowing this people will still go for it all the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today school is about pretending to learn by just memorizing for tests,<br>and as a side effect to line pockets of all the liars and pests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who could ever think pixel art can make a family safe and unafraid,<br>or that drawing portraits of celebrities will get the bills paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The act of creation,<br>is the only worthwhile foundation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not aim to fill a student's mind,<br>but lights their flame to Nobly help the Humankind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life without wisdom doesn't work, you know,<br>it only tricks us to think slow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It always comes as a surprise,<br>to find an adult willing to admit they are not yet wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is exactly what fake education will do,<br>it will steal from you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will take all the wisdom and leave us fighting,<br>at a time when we should be uniting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything that surrounds us is misunderstood and messing with our heads.<br>it is not just masks and hospital beds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every argument where both sides are wrong,<br>prevents Humanity from growing strong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are so many misunderstandings that most arguments simply waste life,<br>without wisdom we will only ague about meaningless misery and strife.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of disagreement Humanity must ask what is the next thing we can fix,<br>otherwise we'll waste our minds on broken politics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should be very angry that we accepted neutered education that bans books,<br>and merely feeds checks to all the pretenders and crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a century that we knew had a pandemic coming,<br>educating children to deal with it was the real force of overcoming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And instead of having them fight in all the wars ahead,<br>we have to teach children peace and wisdom instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Broken schools,<br>can only manufacture sharp tools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is the greatest tragedy Humanity has seen,<br>and the only way out of it is wisdom and intellectual hygiene.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to leave all the bad ideas behind,<br>because we can't see the future when we are divided and blind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is heaven, right here right now,<br>and every one of us must to make the future better somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now is when we leave our mark,<br>while we still own that precious spark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...in our books, poems, and especially portraits and pixel art,<br>because self education is the only way to become wise and smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you argue politics and misidentify basic hopes and dreams calling everything a system,<br>that only means someone stole your wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only a fools can hope to live in poverty and keep the world starving too,<br>we need to start thinking things though.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our highest political hopes are nowhere close to prevent children being born poor,<br>that is how sick our delusions of grandeur.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are at the lowest levels of our development and wisdom,<br>Science is the only functional system.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Borders, religions, prisons, forced poverty, and turning young people into tools,<br>is exactly why we need real education and schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What marks a real school is that it induces a culture of wisdom and class,<br>that is the real test that students must pass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Class is an important component of wisdom and greatness,<br>and that is what self education helps the students witness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once they taste their first art show,<br>they will learn something they didn't know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will learn that with authenticity they are capable of great height,<br>and that all along, it has been their right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something as silly as screenfulls of pixel art or interesting computer code,<br>will help them think in a higher mode.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will see themselves as creators and part of the future of Humankind,<br>and rather than overwork they will take to improving their mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized education only forces students to memorize and pretend to know,<br>is just dog and pony show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't tolerate the theft of wisdom and a chance at becoming great,<br>the schools in their greed are teaching students not to invent and create.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The class and culture that the students should adopt,<br>must neither be warped nor stopped.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is their wisdom, dignity, and their brilliance,<br>the very thing behind their resilience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A school that does not ignite the culture of greatness,<br>is fake and it dims the worlds brightness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can all agree that life dear,<br>therefore we must encourage students to wisdom prior to a career.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are the opposite of machines and tools,<br>may you be part of the movement that builds real schools.</div>
