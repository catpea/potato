      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">From College To Wilderness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I went to College and it was awful,<br>I was really excited about Philosophy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted the teacher,<br>to help me understand Slavoj Žižek.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I spent countless hours,<br>listening to his nose issue, and I don't get anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I needed help separating Ayn Rand the Philosopher,<br>from Ayn Rand the Politician.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though Ms. Rand would probably say,<br>it is impossible, I think her mind was too good for Politics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Philosophy teacher only talked about Descartes,<br>and some trivial Boolean inference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right before finals a boy got up,<br>and asked who is the Des-carte-s guy (he didn't know how Descartes is spelled).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As to the logic, it would be brilliant,<br>to code up a little inference engine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We could all reason about it,<br>extend it and search for flaws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Walking away from a Philosophy class with code for an expert system,<br>is the only way a Philosophy teacher can show class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that boy, He just does finals,<br>because that is what you do when a school does not teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending Memorization is Education,<br>and paying $500 bucks for course plus $200 for sh&t-books is a lot worse....</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Than thinking Descartes and Des-cate-s,<br>are two different people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was the best class the college had,<br>so I took art to relax and just people watch instead.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">First time I was painting Mona Lisas,<br>I left some pain on the easel, the main teacher called me a pig behind my back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We had a substitute teacher just come in and linger for a bit,<br>and her and I briefly spoke about education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She said "Teenagers Are Hormones" and I realized,<br>teachers are not just ripping us off, they are insulting us behind our backs too - it part of their friendship making.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She finally asked about my credentials,<br>I said I was a student once.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Second time, when the teacher that called me a pig was going to lecture in a class I signed up for,<br>I told her I had a 4.0 that I wanted to protect...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because I just assumed she was unreliable,<br>and she lit up with the words "New Assistant" or something like it, in her eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not bloody likely, but,<br>I taught her how to use a wall projector, and do straight lines with acrylic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The trick to prevent paint getting beneath the painters tape,<br>is to first leak pain t in there on purpose, but of the color that is already there, in order to seal the tape gap.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So if you want to paint a yellow square on a blue background,<br>you tape off a square, and then paint it the same color as the background that is already there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The paint is going to leak beneath the tape, but it won't be noticeable,<br>the thing is, your yellow layer won't be able to leak beneath the tape anymore, the blue sealed your tape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you paint your yellow square, and peal the tape,<br>you will see some fresh blue paint, that leaked under the tape, but no yellow leaks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will have a square so sharp,<br>that you will wish it was a lite bit crooked as now all your other lines have to be equally as perfect.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">She did not think to change the way she teaches,<br>even though helping students with proportions would keep them in art forever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead she thought the crooked figure was superior,<br>she was pushing untrained students to doodle, and she'd grade that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where what they needed was <span>help with proportion tools<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>so that they could move past it, and into tone and color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A crooked untrained figure says title about an artist,<br>but grading it says quite a lot about the teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grids, projectors, Camera Obscura, Vincent van Gogh's Diamond frame,<br>Image References in Krita, semi-transparent layers in other programs - teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They train the hand and eye,<br>better than any teacher ever, EVER, will.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I made the Deans List, or the list of people that make their college look legitimate,<br>and especially those who are most likely to pay for more lectures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, I packed my backpack and had,<br>extreme adventures at the Nordhouse Wilderness in Michigan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lived through powerful storms,<br>I made many Raccoon friends, and I named them all Friday.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a young Philosopher, even,<br>he was bicycling from Maine, to try to deal with tragedy...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And figure out what the hell was going on with his neurology,<br>I told him we are not crafted to be perfect - hell, even a computer isn't crafted to be perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are a magnificent burp of the complexity of universe,<br>we are here out of accident and its fundamental principles, I paraphrased GelMann</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think his Mom was following him in his incredible adventure, with bicycle parts,<br>trail mix, good advice - but not help, this kid was riding on his own, sleeping in ditches and farmer fields.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I saw them talk about what I said slowly turning towards me under shady tree from a distance,<br>maybe they just went home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He had his answer, there was nothing wrong with him,<br>we just need to take good care of our selves, our brains need good care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are not to live in sorrow and mourning,<br>we are to learn; and rise; and aim to become great beings.</div>
