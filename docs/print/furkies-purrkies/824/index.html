  <div class="paragraph">Please don’t get discouraged because of strange geometry things,<br>it is an invitation, and so is manual modeling, and even wondering if 3D is something that you actually care for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all supposed to be just a beginning,<br>you are to demand an infinity to all artistic adventures you set off on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Blender’s Geometry Nodes are good to learn<sup>[1]</sup></span>, they are just a tool,<br>it is a <span>geometry modifier<sup>[2]</sup></span>, that you program - it is one of many things.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Schools are not working,<br>and standardized education will eventually be perceived as fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need to get your armour on,<br>you need to stand up for your own Education, Knowledge and Excellence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning an Open Source program is a good investment,<br>even better, if this is your first time learning about 3D Modeling in general.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can make a pencil case, a superhero belt, a wallet,<br>you can create animation, or jewelry, and then sell some of those things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe a lot of them, but either way, expanding your talents,<br>will give you ideas, it will give you more strength.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Geometry nodes are new,<br>they are odd, very odd, like a puzzle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See some of our greatest inventions,<br>are not built on stable foundations perfectly suited to support them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But rather the things beneath are seemingly unrelated,<br>to the end product, more chaotic, or alien even.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Your favorite story, your treasured paper book,<br>stands upon a tree, that was once likely over a hundred years old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nuclear power, is not actually nuclear,<br>they are just using radioactive materials to boil water to spin a turbine like in old trains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You, you are made of Star Stuff, as Mr. Sagan was fond of saying,<br>the universe was all gas until first generation stars started exploding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And your golden jewelry, doesn't just come from a dying star,<br>but from an exploding supernova, only those can make heavier elements like Gold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mitochondra in your cells,<br>or the powerhouse of the cell as the schools brainlessly call it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is a separate organism, with a bacterial genome,<br>and although it talks to our cells it divides like bacteria.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Likewise, programming 3D things, is not exactly about what you are specifically creating,<br>but about concepts in 3D geometry, first .</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>At first you just learn from tutorials<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>and later that knowledge will come together to make more sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when you are making abstract jewelry,<br>noting there will ever be about jewelry, that world is about geometry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The jewelry world above it,<br>starts with taking what you can of the underlying geometry world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then improving that, expanding it,<br>to create a ring, pendant or earring, that is impossible for a human hand to make.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is just unfair to ask a human to do it,<br>abstract geometry...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In every sense,<br>is not of this world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In some cases it can be said that it is an emergent phenomenon,<br>born of human curiosity, the world of 3D geometry, and plenty of happy little accidents.</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Getting started with abstract jewelry is fun and easy<sup>[4]</sup></span><br><span>just remember that this is a quest into the odd world of 3D geometry with its own rules<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May you set of on countless adventures into the strange worlds of art,<br>for those who wander are never lost.</div>
