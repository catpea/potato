      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">What is A School Class And What Is It For?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a question that should only be answered by example,<br>because by creating a definition you will enable liars to manipulate unsuspecting students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will give you a definition anyway, but only for this poem's sake,<br>and I didn't even try to put any effort in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It is a set of honest, authentic, precious and lovely lectures,<br>that lead to a life-long and profound, positive change, in a student's life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I repeat, this question should only be answered by example,<br>liars will use weasel words and trick students into thinking something is profound, when it really isn't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is an on-going problem, for an example of this kind of fraud,<br>consider the religions that abuse, on prey on the trusting and the loving, and the unsuspecting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And also note, the size of their enterprise,<br>and how many people dip into the profits, important part of which are tax exemptions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Global, organized fraud, is not only real, but an every-day-fact;<br>that people accept by merely being born into a world such a strange idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will find curiosity and fascination to be the driving force,<br>behind learning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The standardized curriculum that forces people into subjects they are not interested in,<br>are merely fraudulent attempts at taking unsuspecting students money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often times, schools evolve to be is so good at it,<br><span>so cunning, that even the smartest of us, have long been taken advantage of, and will do everything to refuse to believe it<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I repeat, the question "What is A College Course Or A School Class",<br>can only be defined by example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will give you,<br>three examples.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My first example is the Art, or Digital Painting to be precise,<br>by starting with a program that allows stretching a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas - such as Krita.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The student is not burdened with the questionable idea of hand-eye-coordination that can only lead to slightly crooked paintings,<br>and is granted access to the perfect shape and color, thus is ready to create Hyperrealistic Art, on the first lecture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is called the kindling of the soul, and not filling of the vessel,<br>we halve lost so many artists to fraudulent lectures, that if we knew, our hearts would break.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My second example is 3D Modelling and 3D Printing, this on one thing, not two separate topics,<br>it is trivial and fascinating to loop cut or subdivide, and extrude the cube.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the student truly fully appreciates this form of art, the moment,<br>they assemble their own printer and are then able to hold their creation in their hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is called providing students with real results,<br>when a student is not provided with real results - it is called fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Initially my third example was going to explain <span>how to learn mathematics with the use of programming languages<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>and underscore that <span>the programming language is a simpler and more consistent way of explaining mathematical concepts<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to explore the subjects of using boilerplate code and a visual programming environment such as node-red,<br>to get the students into the more important parts of code, and not bother them with trivialities that they can figure out on their own by reading some documentation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is worth mentioning that I was going to break down web programming into programming command-line utilities, writing custom code editors,<br>easily building HTTP servers, working on client-side probably with web-components, and explain writing cross platform browser plugins and phone apps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the process revealing a single language that can handle it all rather well,<br>and I'll just note that it is <span>modern JavaScript<sup>[4]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is something more important,<br>a class about growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is not Humanities, Sociology, or Psychology, or even the Mother of All Sciences: Philosophy,<br>this class is just called "Growing Up"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are viruses in our culture, in the culture of every nation, strange and incredibly stupid ideas and rituals,<br>and toxic things that all too many have accepted as normal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to talk about simple mistakes that everyone seems to make,<br>that often have profoundly NEGATIVE consequences...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And SIMPLY,<br>prevent the student from ever ending up in that situation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This type of class or course, in a free school that is globally accessible,<br>will help the world grow wiser and more peaceful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, we are neither teaching the correct classes,<br>nor do we consider that <span>each student learns in a unique sequence and at a different pace<sup>[5]</sup></span>, or time of day, even.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Schools are so broken<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>that <span>even grades are fake<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Modern schools do not seem to care,<br>that students cannot learn by repetition and memorization, they can only learn by understanding and comprehending.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools have misunderstood the magnificence of the human mind,<br>and that we are all extremely intelligent, and geniuses, in more ways than we even recognize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But most importantly, schools have failed to recognize,<br>that to grow up, means to grow all the way up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, the propose of a <strong>real</strong> school class,<br>is to help the world to come together in Peace, and in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
