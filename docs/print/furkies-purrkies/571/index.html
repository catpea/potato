    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the teacher says “I will be unfair, because of reasons”,<br>you get up and leave because of reasons, head for the library where the real teachers are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t sit there stressing out about some pop-quiz,<br>or something unfair, or fake, or unusual, or stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t cry, you don’t let the bullies near you,<br>you don’t jump hoops, you don’t perform for your parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The truth about being under attack is that you are letting them attack you,<br>you are not allowed to do that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I understand that parents will will ask you to move out,<br>if you don’t like what they are saying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It happens to a lot of us,<br>and a lot of kids who are put in that situation end up in a lot of trouble.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If your parents are manipulating you, speak out,<br>tell grand ma, tell aunt, tell the principal, tell the teachers, tell your friends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What you may not do, is take it,<br>because if you take it long enough, it will hurt your mental health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why people are pushed into doing drugs,<br>they are medicating the depression they allowed to crush them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bottom line is, don’t let anybody hurt you,<br>you hear?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you think nobody cares,<br>I care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If somebody is hurting you,<br>they are neither friend nor family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your mind is the most important thing in your world,<br>if it unravels so will everything else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The brilliance of your mind, also gives the universes light,<br>the universe becomes a darker place when a mind is hurt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must protect your mind at all cost,<br>move away from the toxic, do not let it poison you, do not let it fracture you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are to triumph over all your troubles,<br>don’t let the bullies make you like they are.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am going to try to show you how narrated books at the library,<br>can help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But first I must explain how powerful they are,<br>so that you don’t throw the idea away thinking it is useless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you can imagine Human Beings come with some massive adaptations,<br>mostly setup by evolution and some useful random quirks that end up making us Great Survivors and Warriors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The most powerful pain,<br>also triggers our ability to super-rapidly inherit wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Psychological pain of any kind,<br>helps us penetrate complex mental models such as philosophies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more ache, the smarter we get,<br>and the faster wisdom will remove it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools, TV, dumb friends, and stupid people,<br>have stolen the word books from us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars and manipulators stole narrated books,<br>by making us feel shame for listening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though we don’t need that word,<br>as we only need to talk about the Wise Storytellers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are not going to let them steal anything,<br>a book is the soul of the author, it is a sacred gift.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each book is unique,<br>no two stories are the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books cannot be generalized,<br>the fact that it is text on paper or digitized speech has nothing to do with the content.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should never let anyone push you away from books,<br>because that is the same as pushing you away from people into some darkness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stand up for books whenever you can,<br>it is the only reliable way to inherit wisdom.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I want to say “Find Biographies” as that represents real wisdom of real people,<br>but a good biography is actually a Story of Amazing Adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And please go for the narrated books first,<br>sitting over a book and reading the actual words, is the worst way to get at the adventure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Listening to the story, or to the actual author that wrote book if you are lucky,<br>makes an enormous difference.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are many ways to read a sentence,<br>and the author is the safest bet, to get it right.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I found that Wikipedia has a tiny <span>Audiobook awards<sup>[1]</sup></span> category, listing <span>Audie Award<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>British Book Awards<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>Odyssey Awards<sup>[4]</sup></span>, and the <span>Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album<sup>[5]</sup></span>, looking through the provided winner listings is a wonderful way to find your next narrated book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In closing I would like to caution you,<br>narrated books not only relive pain, but also make us intellectually independent and unique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more stories of Adventure, Biographies, Philosophies, the more depth to your tears,<br>the more rage to your word, and the greater the desire to yell out wisdom at street corners.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The books will help you understand that there is plenty to worry about,<br>but they will also show you that it is of no use to be crushed by dark imaginings, or forget that Socrates advises that we should be of good cheer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books will make you blindingly brilliant, and the intellectual part of that is the least of it,<br>you will actually give off blinding light to all those that are on the same path as you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you will learn things that you may wish you didn't know, I was just reading Bill Bryson's Made In America,<br>and not only did I learn that "Pants" is hardly a real word, as it is actually a contraction of the word Pantaloons,<br>which presumably we should use instead, to be proper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also, that it wasn't until 1908 that the word panties stated referring to ladies' underpants,<br>it is safe to say that until 1908 grizzly cowboys would have conversations that would go like this:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">'Ey Cle(D)us, you (/a)nd Cornelius keep h(/a)din on north,<br>'m goin' to stop by Jeb'di(/a)h's and git some fresh p(/a)nties, cause the ones I've been ridi'n in don't wash no more, and st(/a)r(D)ed spookin' my 'orse.</div>
