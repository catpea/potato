  <div class="paragraph">In computer world,<br>the power of infinity is the first lessons we learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a while(true){} loop,<br>or 10 GOTO 10;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The beginning is more than all the superhero stories put together,<br>and the first step forward is nothing short of extraordinary.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Some of us will be drawn to music, or audio,<br>others will be called by virtual worlds, or visual.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ordinarily, that means starting with lmms, or blender,<br>and that is always neat for a little while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there comes a point where you discover,<br>that you compose music by means of an algorithm that you enjoy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There comes a point where you discover,<br>that you model 3D objects by following the same pattern, or algorithm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you ask yourself why should I do all this clicking,<br>over an over, repeating the same pattern?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What if I wrote a program to do it for me,<br>the program is not a machine that takes over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The program is an extension,<br>to your pattern, to your algorithm, to your way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">If you are on the visual side,<br>then <span>JSCAD<sup>[1]</sup></span> or <span>OpenSCAD<sup>[2]</sup></span> is a nice start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are on the audio side,<br>then <span>Tone.js<sup>[3]</sup></span> or <span>Elementary<sup>[4]</sup></span> is a nice start.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The audio does split into more than just music,<br>but for a moment, consider what you have here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have endless songs,<br>that play forever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That are under the control of a programming language,<br>a programming language is the real user interface of a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">School has been lying to you,<br>it is a terrible idea to learn how to use Excel, it is a silly program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When it comes to using a computer the first and foremost,<br>is learning a high level programming language, so that you can automate things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The music teacher has lied to you,<br>you are not supposed to read notes, you are not the machine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are the composer,<br>more than that the year is 2021 now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We got to get on with the times,<br>that means <span>pulse trains<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Music class,<br>is not even in the right time period.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The amount of code required to compose the back beat,<br>is file and rate, two things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need to bother with remembering that the train rate is in hertz,<br>just that the higher the number the faster it goes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The numbers are between 1 and 8 maybe,<br>that's part of the real computer the interface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real and <span>effective music composition that you can take to a night club is about a full orchestra<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>either you have a band or a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>It takes very little to put a computer band together<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br><span>behold the power of the sequence node<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A proper music tutorial takes two days,<br>learning programming in the p5 editor, or even atom and elementary same if not less.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>You have to use the examples, use the boilerplate, if you choose elementary<sup>[9]</sup></span><br>don't try to learn programming from the beginning, learn by modifying the boilerplate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Setting up on something like bandcamp is free, becoming an indie artist is priceless<sup>[10]</sup></span>,<br>you can have your first song ready in 7 days, and your first experimental album out in a month,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But being able to algorithmically get started with fresh albums,<br>is an amazing way to compose super-fresh and energy packed workout and jogging music.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No matter how good the song is, it lasts about a workout and a half,<br>if you can consistently deliver fresh material without stressing about it, you got yourself a business going.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Put the money together and build a school,<br>invest in the labels that your students will create, for a very small percent and put a school on every continent.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you are a visual artist,<br>then know that you are not just creating for the computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us leap into practical applications,<br>and skip over the programming part that I described in the music section.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me ask you, how long will it take you to algorithmically create a concrete apartment building,<br>say one tenth of the scale as part of an art installation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you feel comfy with <span>boolean modifiers<sup>[11]</sup></span><br>all you need to do is model some rooms and generate some staircases.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How long would it take to create factory of unseen artworks,<br>based on interpreting a small part of a random photo, into an alien landscape or even a <span>flotilla of star ships<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How long for a bat-belt, buckle links, and pockets,<br>and here you can define everything by variable, and randomize the design motif.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now think about wallets,<br>how long would it take you to generate few thousand somewhat unique wallet designs, or kits for 3D printing.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Programmatic or Generative Design, inherits your creativity,<br>it is not machine like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is not as automated as it seems,<br>the more generations you create, the greater the challenge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The greater your quest for originality,<br>and the clearer and more powerful, and more plentiful your algorithms.</div>
