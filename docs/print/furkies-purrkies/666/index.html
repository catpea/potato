    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was 3 or 4,<br>I found out about squirrels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also,<br>that they don't want to have anything to do with me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even so, in my mind,<br>they are still the fastest and loveliest creature on earth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this Christmas,<br>I bought them <strong>four</strong> bags of peanuts and composed a song.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will mention,<br>that noticed that one of the squirrels became so happy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That after she finished her lunch,<br>and begun burring the rest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her first hiding spot...<br>was just on top a hand rain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't so much of a hiding spot - even though she tried for all her might,<br>it was more like a peanut display - good for her.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is about fifteen of them around there I live,<br>three or four different tribes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made sure to scatter the peanuts in different places,<br>as not to upset any one in particular.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I left myself a handful of peanuts too,<br>so for a bit we all loudly munched together.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While I composed for the Squirrels before,<br>it was a medieval song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I composed it,<br>for the <span>Sciurine Monastic Brotherhood of Poor-Fellows and Crusader Knights<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I think the Squirrels around here,<br>prefer drums.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As always I must warn you,<br>don't play this song around actual squirrels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unless, you want things to get weird,<br>I mean really weird - just don't do it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a song,<br>that uses drums from all around the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It tries to avoid high pitched sounds,<br>in hopes of letting the drums shine through.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than a repetitive pattern of melodies,<br>each part of the song is new.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This allows the song to flow and evolve,<br>rather than repeat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While this song still carries at a reasonable speed,<br>it actually runs at 280 beats per minute.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Allowing me to interject two samples in the beat sequencer,<br>where there usually is just room for one.</div>
