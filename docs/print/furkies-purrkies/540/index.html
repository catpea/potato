    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Box of alarms, box of grades, box of career, box of look at me, box of retirement, and then some.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are sent into the box of school, high school, college, university,<br>job, career, and Friday night at the bar, to keep you from having a nervous breakdown.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your work friends,<br>will be asking you to get into the box of thinking outside of the box.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And your work will ask you,<br>to be part of the work family box, and then promptly spend years hammering your mental health until retirement.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Your alarm, is torture, you maybe able to handle it,<br>but our minds are far to delicate to be ripped out of sleep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sleep that we aren't getting enough of from stress,<br>loneliness, liars, and nested boxes to a sure end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not a slave, you will not be awaken by a machine,<br>you must balance your days, go to sleep at sunset.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to make this work,<br>you have to connect with nature and sunshine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are too delicate,<br>this type of pressure can only end in depression, and medication.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And probably medication,<br>that isn't a cure, but to make the alarm lifestyle work, at the cost of taking years of our life.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Grades are fake, they are for teachers to see if they are working,<br>and the teachers have all the incentive in the world to fudge the numbers - it is how they put food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are copying grades from your other classes,<br>and they are well aware that the curriculum id a dog an pony show, meant for memorization only.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have no choice but to make a fool out of you,<br>they need to get paid, paid, paid paid, paid, paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you know what, though they sold out the word,<br>they had no choice - the men who sold the world are not the bad guys.Cat</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You were a genus all along,<br>learn from this, learn to question the things you are part of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you really wan to know what tricked you,<br>you didn't read books, biographies, stories about real lives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a great being,<br>but you didn't create a balanced view of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You instead accepted the first things you were told,<br>and most of those are meant to make other peoples lives easier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To grow up is not to follow what others told you or expect of you,<br>it is to become a great being and help humanity not by war, punishment and surveillance, but by means of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Your Greatness.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Career is nonsense, this one is a stick and carrot dog an pony show,<br>and you already tucked away all the proof you need for this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will never out compete liar,<br>when the two of you were volunteering in high schools or colleges...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The liar was coached to arrange worthless newspaper interviews,<br>that they will keep for life in their bullshit portfolio, and a whole lot of them will step on you on their way to kiss ass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only will you be out competed,<br>bu they will force you into their mediocrity, under the threat of losing your dream job.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How are you going to win against entire companies of cunning liars,<br>let me answer that for you - the only way to win is to avoid them entirely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let them have their carrots,<br>you build your own company, and you start in middle school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way to out compete them, is to out think them, by becoming truly knowledgeable,<br>instead of being frustrated at them getting straight A's for kissing teachers ass, and the teacher holding them up as a model student.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let me tell you something, holding them up as a model student to get you to be more like them,<br>they want you to be like the ass kissers to make their own days easier - at the cost of your future, at the cost of your mind - your natural genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Get a 3D printer<sup>[1]</sup></span>, slowly learn <span>Blender<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>create models out of thin air, out of just connecting vertices in 3D space - and let that be your first taste of authentic tangible achievement, that you can touch and hold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From your imagination into your hands,<br>choose an authentic path of true achievement, it is matter of mental and physical health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stay away from liars,<br>because <span>once you become part of an institution made out of liars, they will take everything from you, just like they took from Elsie<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Your mind is a beautiful thing,<br>it is a delicate thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It needs joy and happiness,<br>authentic achievement and real triumph.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it needs to see,<br>we need to see where we are going with full certainty of knowing that it will be worth it, once we are there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The promises that all the other kids or even parents are repeating are not good enough,<br>because graduating from a fake college or an artificial university, will not only derail us but also hurt our mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is it really that hard to believe,<br>that being filled with real joy and real happiness, real knowledge and real achievement, is the right path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need boxes to guide you,<br>go to your library, take to books, find narrated books about real lives, real achievement; and let real teachers be your guide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must grow all the way up,<br>you are meant to become a Great Being.</div>
