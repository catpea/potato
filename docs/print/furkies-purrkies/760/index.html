  <div class="paragraph">Humanity,<br>is a baby.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity can only grow,<br>when people grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And to grow,<br>does not mean a little bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means all the way,<br>until you become a great being.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You will need powerful books,<br>written (and preferably read) by fine storytellers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Normally, children start where parents retire,<br>but in a world corroded by poverty, this is rare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With the power of books,<br>not only do you inherit multiple lifetimes of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But get to stand,<br>on the shoulders of their authors.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Narrated books,<br>are a true treasure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you will find them free,<br>at the library.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you want to know,<br>if there is an alternative to books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is only the curse from which they emerge,<br>the alternative to books, can only be tragedy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In Friedrich's words,<br>"Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich st√§rker"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dr. Frankl describes it with more light,<br>"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</div>

  <div class="paragraph">These are the men,<br>who begun at zero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The men upon whose shoulders,<br>you should stand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those men rose,<br>so that you only needed to read their stories.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not search for an alternative to books,<br>your life is meant to be, much more brighter.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Teachers can't help you,<br>they too have fallen to uneducation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They do not even understand,<br>that a Human Being cannot be graded down or held back.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to walk into the library, with anger, or sass, walk up to the Oracle,<br>and ask about audio books about Philosophy, Science, and then life changing biographies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books are like vitamins,<br>they are somewhat coherent collections of components yet to be assembled in your mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not supposed to understand everything at first,<br>it is hard to understand when a great being is speaking to you, their thoughts so heavy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you deem their ideas worthy, you might wish to consider befriending them,<br>and then try to re-construct, who they were to write like that.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your appreciation for books,<br>is the only way that Humanity can grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the future,<br>will take it from there.</div>
