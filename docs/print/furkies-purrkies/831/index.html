      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Far Future; And The Whole, Greater Than Its Parts</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not differences that make people disagree,<br>it is what they know, what they internalized, what they inherited.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Currently we have decided, to respect those beliefs,<br>no matter what they are so as long as they don't cause immediate harm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But looking at immediate impact of beliefs,<br>and waiting to deal with anomalies if any, maybe too simple at times of climate change, global health risks, and wars reemerging all too often.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe the perfect food for liars and manipulators,<br>as they don't usually plan just one step ahead, as we seem to be doing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For example, <span>rather than just punishing crime and keeping people in cages<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>we need to prevent people from fracturing from poverty and bad ideas, in the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we should accept the responsibility for those that we have failed,<br>and not keep them in cages, but grant them a safe place where they can grow and eventually make a successful return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a very small example of the changes that we must make,<br>and I chose it because it both, demands wisdom, and shows what great restraint and eventually compassion our culture must rise to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way money integrates without world must change as well,<br>no more homelessness, no more hunger, no more poverty, we are better than this, none of us would support such things is asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to fix schools, because electing the least of two wrongs, is madness,<br>any compromise between good and bad will only benefit the bad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to look far into the future, and examine consequences at great depth,<br>we have to anticipate, predict, and learn to prevent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no other way to deal with war, or deal with climate,<br>we can't wait until war starts, we can't wait until it is too late to fix anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Try, fail, learn, and try again, is a stupid idea,<br>it is not a plan of action, is a plan of inaction that causes reemergence of mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many fairy tales we tell ourselves to accept reality,<br>and they "work", during the lifespan of that person, but that is a fool's achievement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let me repeat that, only a fool celebrates lack of incidents,<br>that occur on a different time scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">War does not instantly happen,<br>it takes many decades to effectively and imperceptibly disable education and cripple culture with nationalism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Climate change or deforestation won't happen in a singe life time,<br>darkly speaking, scarcely few register that trees turned to shrubs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Viruses emerge on a scale, where we barely remember what it was like,<br>barely enough for people to refuse to wear masks to impede the spread during the worst of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to learn to think in centuries,<br>in multiple generation, not just lifetimes, or worst yet term limits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We also need to look at the content of a person's character,<br>voting on someone based on gut feeling, or because the other person outs herself as to think in terms of super-predators.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The answer, to who do you vote for, when all candidates are bad,<br>is a stalemate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we arrived here, because we neither have a culture that values wisdom,<br><span>nor do we have a real educational system<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no worthy candidates, because election based systems,<br>demand a beautiful system of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today, we allow students to be bullied, we allow teachers not to see it,<br>and then we allow those students to be held back a year, allowing those bullies to seemingly stain that person for life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At best, we force students into obedience, by rewarding them for memorization,<br>and frightening them with punishment or homelessness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A real school, would teach,<br>what we have today is a fake school, a dangerous idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When someone holds a different opinion, especially when that opinion is clearly wrong or unethical,<br>it simply means that they are a victim of a corroded culture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ineffective education is such that often times both sides are wrong,<br>and they will never agree, a wreched stalemate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To truly capture all sides of all arguments,<br>one must assume that three is no side, no opinion to be had, until one is well educated, well read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world can't keep disagreeing, because climate change, health risks, and and nuclear war,<br>care little for borders.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a good feeling to hold an opinion, to feel passionately about something,<br>but it is a better feeling, when that opinion is based on love of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is powerfully human, all too human,<br>and our love for it is a sign of how noble and beautiful human beings truly are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look into your hear,<br>could you ever say "I hate wisdom" has such a phrase ever been uttered - it is because it is so deeply ours, so blindingly human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is our destination to converge on,<br>it is about all cultures in their most forward thinking looking to eventually converge on wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In other words, Humanity now requires a shift to a culture of Wisdom and Greatness,<br>so that do have candidates we can vote on, and so that they in their wisdom will protect education, and prevent repetitions of mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom, is both an operating system,<br>and, a direction towards which we can move with books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By asking people to converge on wisdom first,<br>our differences will fade, eventually our culture will synchronize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To build the content of character necessary,<br>for us all, to have a safe, and happy future, our greatest mistakes will need to be repaired.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A philosopher once said that a culture is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable,<br>those who live in poverty, those made ill, and those kept in prisons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have a great deal of work on our hands, and the politicians who lied themselves into high positions,<br>are utterly incapable of comprehending what it all means.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The politicians are great at simple things, naps, war, prison,<br>retributionism, and re-elections to name a few.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if the new generation rose to become wise,<br>they would still be largely out-competed by lairs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To kindle wisdom in enough people and help them to the necessary content of character,<br>requires multiple generations, a global cultural shift.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was never going to be any one leader to move all the people,<br>it was always bout the people becoming the leaders they wish they had.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Until that cultural shift occurs,<br>and we begin taking care of all in need, and we have enough wisdom and foresight to permanently end poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to wisdom, and make sure everyone around you loves wisdom too,<br>stand up for real education, begin speaking out against shortsightedness, stupidity, and injustice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When pressured by madmen, get up and leave them to the world they want,<br>find a different state, a different culture, or a different country, so that you are safe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that you may teach all your hard earned wisdom,<br>so that it may outlive and outlast all the fools, their lies and shortcomings, and all the injustice in the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The one thing about liars, is that they are temporary, and if do earn a place in history, it will be as an example of disgrace,<br>you, build a castle in time, where no lie could eve hope to stain it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The road ahead will take a very, very long time,<br>because we will neither fight the liars back, nor dance on the graves of the world's enemies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will simply outlast them by inspiring others to wisdom, counting their numbers down,<br>waiting for Great Wisdom and Foresight to lead the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Begin tonight, clear a shelf and begin your search for the worlds best writers and story tellers,<br>find narrated versions with fine narrators and make that the bed time story.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you take to books, the books will grant you the power to narrate and write,<br>and your voice recordings will be a treasure to be enjoyed by the future generations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,<br>can help the world leave its differences and mistakes in the past.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May all the cultures use wisdom,<br>to converge together towards peace and a safer and happier world for our entire Great Human Family.</div>
