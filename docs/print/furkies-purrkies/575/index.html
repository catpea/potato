  <div class="paragraph">We all need to start somewhere,<br>and with a place for a comfortable armchair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A laboratory is perfect for that,<br>plus it is a nice place to rest at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A secret laboratory is great,<br>but it can be as small as your 3D printer plate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you don’t make a big boom,<br>you can probably event setup in the living room.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But above all it is about a solid start,<br>to all your unique art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use a projector to start painting,<br>you can outline anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get an <span>Ender<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and print a screw you generated in <span>Blender<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Easy peasy meow,<br>and you can start right now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all about starting and then moving along,<br>and this path is life long.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We don’t know why we have fake education,<br>but it affects every person in every nation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually it will catch up to them,<br>and it will be up to you to fix the mayhem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even wining a great prize,<br>will not fix problems that are about to arise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world needed real schools and real wisdom,<br>but we ended up with a broken system.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now we have to teach the world to grow,<br>but this is a talent that the self-taught know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To make real changes right now,<br>you will need to replace schools somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education will soon be in real need,<br>and the world will need a leader that can lead.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world does not need to unite to look up to you,<br>it needs leaders that will teach, inspire, and stay true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It needs you in narrated books,<br>so that everyone can learn from you despite all the crooks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Due to climate and political change,<br>the new schools need to have a wider range.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lectures can’t be cut up by some abstract subject,<br>they must be self guided and actually connect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world is not coming to an end,<br>but education is something that we must fix and defend.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It all needs a simple start,<br>and there is nothing more pleasant than beginning with art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then move onto computers, programming, and design,<br>and make all your lessons connect and align.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you get a taste for real education and school,<br>it will become your most powerful tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then all you need to do is help others to the same,<br>and that is not an impossible aim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once the idea of self education takes root,<br>wisdom and real education will bear fruit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The next generations will take it from there,<br>they will view climate change as something they can repair.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than bringing all the students to school,<br>create a new tool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bring the school to all the students, to that they can learn for real,<br><span>in a place where there are no paycheck to steal<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self paced and self guided learning for real is fun,<br>and at every step of the way the students will feel they have won.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one will have to ask them to pay attention,<br>they will be too busing building some invention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The future is always bright,<br>but we must help the world learn for real, and keep things right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each generation, must guard real education,<br>despite all the borders we are one family, one real nation.</div>
