  <div class="paragraph">Yes. Using the Free Open Source Blender, a 3D Modeling program<br>to create objects for 3D printing works with pure perfection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is a “<span>Check All<sup>[1]</sup></span>” button that will warn you,<br>if you did something that will confuse the printer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This button is like a conductor,<br>it will tell you to re-do an operation if you did it in a way that computers/printers dislike.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Tell me now, how can you make a mistake,<br>how can you get stuck in a design that is constantly monitored for problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can’t,<br>you get instant feedback about problems in your models.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Five or six days ago,<br>I begun teaching myself raw vertex operations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A vertex, is like a fly stuck in space time,<br>you get to move it wherever you want.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Two flies, or points give you the ability to create a line,<br>in a way that computers understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Three or better yet four points,<br>give you the ability to create a plane, like a zero thickness piece of paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now you are just doing origami,<br>you are just wrapping something with paper, which is held up by flies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made a fancy wallet,<br><span>it had my second hinge design<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it also had problems,<br>my flies were little crazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the lines they were drawing,<br>kind of looked right, but no, they were not OK.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no printer in the world that can print something that just looks OK,<br>printers care about the guts of your model.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your 3D models need to be converted to gcode by means of a slicer,<br>this is an old language used by all the old angry machines in a factory.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is better that geometry is nice and neat,<br>hit that check all button after every operation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A slicer is a program that is separate from Blender,<br>blender exports 3D models in stl format.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a slicer will, convert the 3D model to the motions of the 3D printer head,<br>which is called a Hot End, in addition to that it also controls the speed of the extrusion of plastic, the temperature of the bed and hot end, and a hundred little tiny things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slicers can fix models,<br>but not reliably.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure to install the 3D Print Addon under Preferences,<br>it is already shipped with Blender.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And let the Check All button teach you about the operations,<br>that you can reliably perform.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Just moments ago I tried to extrude a little latch for the fifth version of that wallet,<br>and I couldn't just extrude upwards without triggering errors after hitting that check all button.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Computers and languages,<br>have limits, not everything is always possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So what I did, was extrude a new area forward <strong>not upward</strong>,<br>and then I grabbed the top of the newly exposed surface and pulled it up, an it worked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is probably possible to wrestle the mesh for an hour and get it all working.<br>but it is just more reasonable to alter the design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In case of precision parts that must match a particular shape,<br>getting stuck requires starting a new project and rebuilding the same shape, with a different strategy.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The check all button, is far superior to any teacher,<br>and it will make you a master of proper high quality Manifold Models.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And here we arrive at the closing part of this text,<br>and we must talk about the <span>Cybertruck<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of Industrial Product Designers are upset,<br>some complain about the lack of detail, others are scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the Cybertruck is a good lesson in not fighting 3D models,<br>but just letting them be what they want to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The set of hinges I created last Friday are perfect,<br>they are so perfect...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That <span>the first is too precise for cheap 3D printers<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>and <span>the second, is too flawlessly round to not trigger all kinds on Non-manifold geometry alerts<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>My latest wallet design, embraces square geometry<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>the way the Cybertruck did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My third hinge assembly is based on inset nested squares,<br>I am not 100% certain the prototype will open.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I am 100% sure, I can adjust the geometry of the top and bottom case,<br>to make it forgive each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went with the flow of my tool chain,<br>and my <span>PrusaSlicer<sup>[7]</sup></span> announced the model is perfectly Manifold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As with the Cybertruck,<br>if you have a good reason to break the rules of design, do it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because eventually you will find yourself wondering,<br>how to make your art more unique anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Letting your tools have a say,<br>is wise, because this way you will be in harmony with your toolbox and won’t have to fight it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please, keep in mind how important learning modeling is,<br>High School and College will teach you little and put you in debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>A cute little oddly terrifying 3D design<sup>[8]</sup></span> that frankly, could use some googly eyes to shake things up,<br>can, on the other hand, bring in $410,000 dollars, by selling 12,820 times at $32 bucks per order.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody will ever catch High Schools pimping students out for state funding,<br>but we can see the fraud by comparing the results of organized education with self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May your designs sell a ton, may your print beds be perfectly flat and level,<br>may you never run out of the print filament, and may you never run out; of adventure.</div>
