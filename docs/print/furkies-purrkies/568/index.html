  <div class="paragraph">So as long as leaders are moving along,<br>generations wont seem that long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Few years here, few years there,<br>and you will have to make repair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you you got to grow up fast,<br>and make sure your contributions last.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">That is how it goes,<br>so as long as everybody knows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all extremely smart,<br>and our lives are meant to unfold like art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That we are meant to become wise,<br>no matter how many tries.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But we can't pretend,<br>as that can only lead to a sad end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All the politicians must be great,<br>as it is time to put an end to hate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not the world that must unite,<br>it is only the children that have to get that right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The adults will be gone soon enough,<br>they are not even that tough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world has always belonged to the children,<br>proven time and again.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The politicians are pushed to pretend,<br>and they won't care to what end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They may just sit there babbling blind,<br>and won't even notice the unraveling of their mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They won't look very far ahead,<br>they just want to look good instead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do as little as possible" - they say,<br>and then leave the office promptly on their last day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This should make them look crazy and strange,<br>because we need real change.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">What the world really needs,<br>is great deeds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each life is to be a sensation,<br>and serve as great inspiration.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is how we get really educated,<br>and that is how true leaders are created.</div>

  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And with true and wise leaders abound,<br>a new age of enlightenment will come around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, the liars and the sleazy,<br>won't have it so easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We'll sort short from long visions apart,<br>and regain the use of our heart.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">All it takes to start,<br>is listening to interesting books and getting adventure-smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Books, is all it takes,<br>to spot all the damn crooks.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you take to adventure and live,<br>and stand up to the crooks and never forgive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before you know it you become wise,<br>and continue to rise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have give speeches to great ovation,<br>you just need to help the younger generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This way you are not just an army of one,<br>buy inspire everyone.</div>
