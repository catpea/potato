      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">On The Future Of Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the biggest mistakes schools make,<br>is teaching things in a way that requires other things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is similar to the madness of "Balanced Education",<br>it sounds reasonable, but it is just another crazy thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When children ask what math is for,<br>that is not a question to be brushed away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are simply letting the teacher know,<br>that she lost her mind, for teaching a subject without presenting a useful context first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Doing so, is a solid sign of fraud,<br>disconnected things increase student performance, because they just memorize them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is fraud,<br>that is fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more difficult subjects,<br>are actually good drivers for quickly learning the pre-requisite in a neat context.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning programming by starting with a game design,<br>is a wonderful example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here there is a need for fractals, calculus,<br>and trigonometry for placing things on the screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here a person who has an interest in making games,<br>probably won't even notice learning numbers as the study of mathematics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The word that they may use is computation,<br>and while nothing should be timed... as that is a stupid idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be students who will master trigonometric functions in minutes,<br>some may not even register mastering it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, it would be nice to peek at the source code of the trigonometric functions,<br>writing ones own library with useful helper functions, could be great fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of those students would fail trigonometry,<br>without the context of game graphics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are failing school,<br>but they are not failing their genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many just become convinced,<br>they don't have it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers love anything that makes their grades stick...<br>so that they can put food on their table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Needless to say learning Arithmetic and Algebra, by starting with Calculus,<br>is a bad example as all three of those are taken out of context.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will find that school strip things down to the very minimum,<br>making the subjects easy to test, and making it easy to show evidence of fake progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Normal people do not learn by memorizing,<br>normal people learn by understanding a thing in a context that is relevant to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can flavor a programming language,<br>with an exciting infinitely large procedurally generated games.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because there is something magical,<br>about virtual worlds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of mathematics teaching Generative Art, and Cellular Automata,<br>or Orbital Dynamics be it for Game Development or Launching <span>CubeSats<sup>[1]</sup></span> can create a useful contexts for many.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Different people will have unique aims,<br>it is those aims that will set the correct context to learn for real in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real lectures open in the beginning,<br>and close in the end - they form a coherent whole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Assuming the student knows,<br>is one of the biggest failures in modern education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps a close second,<br>to the entirety of the fraud of it all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to learn to understand that when something is divided into a meaningless unit,<br>one that is disconnected from the rest of the world of mathematics, for example...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Than that simply means it has little to do with mathematics, or anything,<br>and is thus meaningless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The moment the student asks,<br>why the need to know this subject, is the movement that marks the school's failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is simply not true that those who graduate with better grades are more intelligent,<br>considering how crude and broken schools are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That may be an indicator of a mindset that will make for a useful employee,<br>for a company that cares little about mental health, or presenting a real retirement plan.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There may not be a way to fix schools,<br>the idea is wonderful but the implementation is easily exploited, and it does not scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lectures have to be personal,<br>they have to be relevant to each of the students' unique aims.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have to resist fraud completely,<br>as they deal with people who do not have the experience to spot it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No tests, for example, tests cannot test if a programmer can write a programs,<br>only writing and publishing the program will work in this case.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No grades, only the result matters,<br>grades only contribute to the fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Teachers manipulate grades<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>to ensure that nothing out of the ordinary registers - they are grading their own performance, after all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This means that video based, computerized education is a good candidate,<br>but lecture quality has to be on par with world's bestsellers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can't quite imagine what that would look like,<br>a fascinating inspirational two hour move like experience for every lecture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They <strong>have to be</strong> the books, audio books, video lectures, and movies,<br>that are truly worthy of the students that represent the future of Human Kind.</div>
