  <div class="paragraph">I learned how to make a Raspberry Pi button recently,<br>but I researched it my way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I wanted to see if there was a way to do it on the command line<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>with the simplest kind of programming, there is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>GPIO header<sup>[2]</sup></span> is represented with files,<br>on a Raspberry Pi.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I gave some thought to store bought devices,<br>as they relate to custom made ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think store-bought is not that cool anymore,<br><span>in his funny song Thrift Shop<sup>[3]</sup></span>, Macklemore calls it "getting tricked by a business", to say the least.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Plus the moment you scratch your screen your new device becomes old,<br><span>if you made it yourself, then you just get a new $20 screen<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And, hey,<br>maybe add some <span>cool extras<sup>[5]</sup></span>, while you're at it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">YEEES, It is true that homemade hardware, is freaking huge,<br>and sometimes you may need your friend to carry your phone in his backpack.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is what friends are for...<br>I think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is just something really weird abut not knowing what is in your pocket, what is in your store bought phone,<br>criminal phone hacking is only going to become more elaborate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has never been a good idea to keep personal things,<br>on an internet connected device.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The phones are going to use cheaper components,<br>become more expensive, and more closed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And pretend a lot harder,<br>that recommendations are not ads.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you make your own phone, you get to reason about the components,<br>it seems to me that a GPS map, should have a huge screen much bigger than a phone, and a bigger battery too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you use an overpriced off-the shelf phone,<br>you don't get a choice.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Anytime you build something,<br>you learn something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a reasonably sized Raspberry Pi Zero Mp3 player,<br>with those amazing slow and soft turning aluminum knobs for volume, treble and bass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or two or three 8GB Raspberry PIs jammed into a <span>Beautiful Vintage Brick Phone<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>with a springy antenna that doubles as a wifi hotspot for your 1024 closest friends...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...and maybe runs a leaked version of old MySpace, or Friendster,<br>or just freaking <span>GeoCities<sup>[7]</sup></span> where your whole family can come together and upload some Under Construction content with fancy GIFs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wouldn't it be amazing if all the telemarketers,<br>would have to <span>find their way around a little labyrinth<sup>[8]</sup></span> and fight a <span>Freaking Grue<sup>[9]</sup></span>, before they could leave a voice mail?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am pretty sure,<br>they would love it.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Old is new, again,<br>it is hard to explain, it will be somewhat hard to learn, and it will take forever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But not only won't it cost an arm and a leg,<br>building custom electronics, and learning programming, paints a pretty clear career path.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is what High Schools were supposed to be for,<br>but they just can't do it, they don't know how to teach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be it electronics and Linux,<br>or Windsurfing, Day Hiking, or painting, or better yet whatever call to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It helps you with Knowledge, with Wisdom,<br>it is neither about some specific achievement like an MP3 player, or an Olympic Medal in Gymnastics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is about the million things you learn,<br>while you are in pursuit of curiosities, and adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to pay attention,<br>to whether or not we are actually learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And all that we ever need to learn,<br>is all the things that are fun and interesting to us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is that path,<br>that teaches us everything else along the way.</div>
