  <div class="paragraph">Though art was always near,<br>and all intentions seemed dear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world gives into in broken things,<br>and when change comes it is tied by strings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers forget what their students were like,<br>and once they graduate even students forget to strike.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes a Humanity to move the future in a new direction,<br>and many hopes will be broken by rejection.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the lies and half measures are brittle by design,<br>sometimes all Humanity needs is a single sign.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are amazing as learning by subtle analogy,<br>a talent deeply rooted in our psychology.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is why art holds a special place in out word,<br>it teaches us not to merely do what we are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art challenges us to grow,<br>and here no pace is too slow.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It shows us, we each have a unique sequence in which we learn,<br>and that each precious step is something we must earn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We learn layer by layer to become strong,<br>and finally, we learn to see what went wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We see the cramming, and the shame, threat and fear,<br>and we see that learning stops here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools only work when they continue evolving,<br>otherwise they add to problems they are meant to be solving.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With all those who have invested into broken things,<br>standing there tied by strings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We learn to see that the world can only grow,<br>when teachers teach, and not stand thew hollow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The change cannot come from within,<br>this is an old battle that no one can win.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It must come in the form of of our greatest hopes,<br>only then can the world break the ropes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can build a more peaceful world and a much more compassionate system,<br>but it requires that we each aim for nothing less than greatness wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what we may think or what we are taught or told,<br>we can break out of any mold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This great challenge requires that we each aim to become great,<br>as only in great wisdom, can we all reject lies, war and hate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a world without real teachers, <strong>we</strong>, must learn to teach,<br><strong>and that</strong> must be the first height we reach.</div>
