    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This strange poem is not really about fixing old plumbing,<br>it is about the power of design.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't particularly need a lion head tub handle,<br>but I am speechless about what a wonderful way to further my 3D modeling skills this is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When there is nothing to do on holidays,<br>but wait for the stores to reopen, I take to creating cool things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Originally I would write little programs,<br>but now I also compose, and as the case is today refuse to properly fix my shower.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With a horrendous roar,<br>my shower announced it needs new washers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The repairs only take a short moment,<br>but it took a long time to understand what is going on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In short the Tub Spout is destined at a wrong angle,<br>small drops of water will run along the tub spout and into the wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The water leaks because,<br>the washers get used up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the washers get used up,<br>because the pipe that washers press against has corded and became sharp.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The corroded assembly maybe 40 years old,<br>I may need to to use my dremmel to take off the edge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think of this as fun detective work,<br>I would never guess that the minor leaks can run along the tub spout into the wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of just dripping down,<br>like it should - where is gravity when you need it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then of course the newly broken knob,<br>squeaked at me again as if to inquire on the status of her redesign.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The water stem that stick out of the wall,<br>has these little grippy teeth that have worn out as it is a soft metal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This calls for a replacement which probably costs $10,<br>but not before I try to print out my own idea of how it should all work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This looks like a job that will include the use of epoxy glue,<br>I've designed a stem sleeve with its own teeth that are meant to get in between the worn out ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With hopefully quick drying hard epoxy glue,<br>it shouldn't be a problem at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The reason I designed the stem sleeve separately from the shower/tub handles,<br>is because I want to try out different designs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is also why I made the water stem that sticks out of the wall and holds the handles,<br>square.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My design does not need a screw it just snaps on,<br>there is a square hole in the back of the handles I designed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The square sleeve can accept simple designs,<br>but also things like lion heads, anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is worth mentioning that there are overhangs in these parts,<br>one example is the inset screw at the end of the stem sleeve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means I need to use supports,<br>this is an automatic feature of slicing software.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It just fills in where the printer would be forced to print on air,<br>and the fill is like a simple mesh that is easy to snap off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The supported surface will fee rough after removal of the support material,<br>that can mean sanding it down, or in my case leaving it be as the inset is covered by the screw head.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">3D Modeling for 3D printing has to take air gaps under consideration,<br>this can be challenging in complex designs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>machine-gun like wallet I recently made<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>actually started off on paper, and completely eliminates the need for supports.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is is my first large print out and it does suffer from warping,<br>though it is just the outside part of the wallet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Warping is another thing to consider during 3D modeling,<br>to put it simply plastic shrinks a tiny bit as it dries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes this may cause lifting of the part being printed,<br>which demands setting the print surface hotter and a brim.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Brims, like the brim on a hat,<br>aim to prevent a part from lifting.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All these issues, require practice,<br>and to make practice fun, fixing things around the house is the way to go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which is why I made my shower,<br>the subject of today's poem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The lions head handle,<br>is actually the beginning of my New Year's resolution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With what I have learned thus far,<br>I am able to add Designing Jewelry as a hobby.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I print in plastic because it is inexpensive and great for prototyping,<br>but <span>there are companies that print in wax to make molds, and pour molten metals inside<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While it is too scary for me,<br><span>some people are fine with lost wax casting at home<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is somewhat of a tradition to make a Lion's Head ring,<br>and that will be my first project of this New Years resolution: Begin Designing Jewelry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not actually cost me anything up front,<br>the rings will only be poured after a purchase is made.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They won't be too expensive to the customer either,<br>I will sell in Bronze, Gold and Silver.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I want to present this little story,<br>as an example of self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is not time in school to learn for real,<br>it may not be possible to get a solid education out of a standardized curriculum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are thinking beings,<br>we must learn, and we must learn for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real skills,<br>that enable us to create real things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need context for learning,<br>be it a shower handle or a precious jewelry piece we need a reason to learn and remember.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must not allow ourselves to be tricked into a fake education,<br>that only wastes our time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Self Education above all,<br>and from Knowledge comes Wisdom, and from Wisdom Greatness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Happy New Year.</div>
