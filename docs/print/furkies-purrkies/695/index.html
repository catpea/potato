    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am deeply embarrassed to say that I finished ホイスト (Hoist[o]),<br>this is my first Pop Surrealist work of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am so embarrassed about the underwear situation,<br>that upon waking from my nap, I said: "No, I am more mature than this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But since my nap, I've come to realize,<br>that my silly embarrassment only makes the painting better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I recently explained,<br>why Superman's underwear is on the outside of his leotard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to get in touch with the Pop Surrealist in me,<br>and strange underwear habits was what came from it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As to why the shirt is in the underwear, and why it must stick out so horribly,<br>I just imagined it happened to Clark Kent sometimes when he put his disguise on too fast.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the reason you see a Harvard tie,<br>is because I've been somewhat writing about education improvements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I guess I am trying to say,<br>that education and not a tie makes a graduate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The shoes are an artistic touch,<br>I almost doubled them in size and they completely made the lower portion of the painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I knew they would look so great,<br>I would have painted the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 - the coolest shoes that of course don't' come in wide.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I painted the 8lb dumbbells that I actually dance with at the gym,<br>for sentimental reasons, I love my workouts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The background color comes from animator's palette,<br>right now I think all my Pop Surrealist paintings will have that background.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that color also reminds me of Japan,<br>it is just really warm and interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The signature you see here, is a <span>Hanko<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>it says Warrior or Samurai in Japanese.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always admired Hankos in Japanese watercolors and calligraphy,<br>they seemed so mysterious to me, when I first encountered them on Japanese Watercolors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I've experienced no trouble from Krita,<br>and the <span>Pen Tablet<sup>[2]</sup></span> has performed well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because I was still learning,<br>the painting took approximately 20 hours, or four afternoons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I found it to be a little bit too large for my first painting,<br>it didn't get boring, but if I had to relive this moment I'd would create four separate paintings instead.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The glassy eyes posed no problems for me,<br>it is just a transparent gray stroke of Air Brush, and two highlights.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A huge one that creates the rounded shape,<br>and the little one that reflects the moon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can see that the sizes of the folds in the fabric seem unnatural,<br>this is because it is a record of me learning how to do it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for me the key is to use the Q-Tip Brush Preset,<br>as it blurs and mixes colors really well - very powerful and useful brush.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fur was the biggest surprise for me, so as long as you start with dark fur first and the go lighter and lighter,<br><strong>and</strong> remember to lower the opacity of your brush, it is a very easy process.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The eye lashes as I have them would work for a normally shaped eye,<br>but it is too much for eyes like you see here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The next painting that is calling to me is as simple as <span>Mark Ryden's Bee<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>one such simple painting a day would be good practice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I also want to create Celebrity Caricatures,<br>I wanted to draw caricatures ever since I was little.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When it became easy with <span>Kai's Power Goo<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>where I could use the goo'd portraits as reference, I searched for a greater challenge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I used to go to Barnes and Noble to spend my Fridays searching for interesting Art and Programming books,<br>when I came across <span>Mark Ryden's Art<sup>[5]</sup></span>, I knew that those faces is what I wanted to learn to paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So my next big step, is practicing Pop Surrealism on celebrity portraits,<br>as in recognizable faces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I should add that I am also able to model my paintings in Blender first,<br>where I could work on pop surrealist sculptures and jewelry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I only have one painting,<br>it is the first Painting that will appear in my Art Book, that is a very big step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I encourage all to Practice Krita and take to Pop Surrealism,<br>we are all natural born Artists, all it takes is some nice music and <span>easy tutorials<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
