    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some years ago,<br>I woke up and said whoa!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For I knew I was ready,<br>to get on my bicycle and ride steady.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hour was 4 am,<br>I got ready and bam!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was headed for lake Erie,<br>and was feeling pretty cheery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had my water and traimix,<br>and my phone to take some pix.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sun came up real soon,<br>and before I knew it was as noon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I knew how to get to <span>Flatrock<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>as I once discovered it with a shock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a <span>strange secret passage in a park<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>but past that point I was in the dark.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I asked "How to get to the lake?",<br>a man pointed a finger and gave his head a shake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I got back on my iron horse,<br>and set a new course.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was headed east,<br>or so I thought at least.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I got lost and discovered a cute coffee shop,<br>but I didn't have time to stop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I sped up and down the road,<br>in my detective mode.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a sign,<br>but no coastline!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moment later I was lost,<br>I mumbled, "Where is that darn coast?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I kept going,<br>and I wasn't slowing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were train tracks,<br>and sidewalks full of cracks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a road full of cars,<br>and abandoned bars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally a paved little trail,<br>that started by the local rail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I got on it and pedaled some more,<br>and then before I knew it I made it to the shore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It came out of nowhere,<br>it almost seemed unfair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I perched upon a pier,<br>and exclaimed "Oh Dear"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lake was very pretty,<br>as was the little city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now,<br>I had to get back and I wasn't sure how.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I stuffed my cheeks,<br>full of trail-mix.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And headed west,<br>back to my nest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was twice as hard to bet back,<br>and I could really feel the weight of my pack.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made it out of the park,<br>but it was already getting dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I got back very late,<br>but I felt great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would rate the adventure 10/10,<br>never again.</div>
