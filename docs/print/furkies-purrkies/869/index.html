      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Writing Programs</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I always write computer programs,<br>I am always trying to write something neat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been quite a journey,<br>long enough to observe technology change.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also learned a bunch of languages I don’t use,<br>I use JavaScript now but it used to be slow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Back then I wrote in PHP and Perl,<br>I liked them both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am too busy with JavaScript to miss them,<br>there is so much to learn here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">There is this strange joke<br>that a full stack developer can’t exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who do everything are either,<br>Unicorns or Crazy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are serious technology limitations that,<br>make the name “Full Stack Developer” sound ridiculous.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They exist, but they are smart enough,<br>to never tell their employer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And writing User Interface, Server,<br>Command, and Design Principles all at once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Would make a programmer,<br>a slowpoke.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I enjoy the whole round trip,<br>from user interface to server and back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But only with JavaScript, as other languages,<br>are just not mature enough.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In my Java days, dynamic user interface was hard, and it may still be frowned upon,<br>the lovely user interface technology called JavaSwing needed to grow up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">PHP and Perl could create a user interface,<br>but it would be a bad idea to build something serious.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Flash; that old web games were coded in,<br>made a leap forward, once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Before it all fizzled out, their Action Script language,<br>was very powerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their UI framework, called Flex,<br>was a decade ahead in prettiness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Flash and Flex was amazing,<br>but the Flash Player had bugs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And one company wouldn't allow it on their phone,<br>in part because it drained battery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But also because it was somebody else code,<br>and that would be the thing that people would write apps in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don’t want some other company,<br>to own the language that your apps are written in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to the bugs Flash was probably written,<br>in a a low level programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That usually means,<br>humans manage the memory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That often means that a person can <span>inject program instructions<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and may get access to the OS.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Low level languages are fast for lack of bounds checking,<br>but they are also hard, dangerous, and slow to code in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">JavaScript takes care of everything,<br>you just say a = “hello” and it will take care of it for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In C you have to make an array, or a list,<br>and then put letters in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You also have to specify how big the array is,<br>and you can’t go over that number.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you do, then you may damage memory,<br>for some other thing, or allow code injection.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Full Stack developers avoid slow things,<br>and this gives them superpowers.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Just a moment ago, I generated code files on my disk,<br>using <span>babel<sup>[2]</sup></span> which allowed me to use syntax that is not yet part of JavaScript.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I triggered this generation, on the server,<br>under the control of a sweet event Emitter by means of <span>engine.io<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I actually don’t really see a difference,<br>between talking to a program component or a server.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is all event emitters, I don’t have to manage web sockets,<br>and they are so helpful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is just the server magic,<br>my user interface, allows for complex automatic layouts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My programs and website work on large screens, and tiny ones,<br>as I use <span>Bootstrap<sup>[4]</sup></span>, it took some getting used to .</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But more than that, I use <span>svelte<sup>[5]</sup></span>,<br>so my program automatically reacts to me making assignments to variables.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don’t have to remember to call userInterfaceUpdate(),<br>nor do I have to pollute my code with it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But even more than that,<br>I can build my own code editor in a singe afternoon.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I can inject a <span>code editing area<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>anywhere in my user interface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visual Basic, C, Perl, PHP, ActionScript, Java,<br>just don’t do this kind of thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can each do one thing,<br>but not everything at once like I can do in an afternoon.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you know, I used <span>gulp<sup>[7]</sup></span> and <span>vinyl<sup>[8]</sup></span> for my virtual file system,<br>and my server code is less than 10 lines and I have access to all gulp plugins.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not any one thing that makes this kind of programming so mighty,<br>it is all the things combined together in simple harmony.</div>
