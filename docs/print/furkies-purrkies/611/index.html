  <div class="paragraph">While the world is still growing up,<br>and is yet to end poverty and stop repeating its own mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ongoing the disagreements, suspicions, divisions,<br>are just about levels of education.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real schools are hard to build,<br>they may even be impossible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Forcing standardized knowledge on students,<br>under a stress of failure is not how a human being learns.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education,<br>should serve as a model for real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A student should learn in a sequence that fits them best,<br>and matches their existing knowledge and predispositions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students have to move at a comfortable pace,<br>and only study when they re ready to study.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forcing students to learn what they are not interested in.<br>under a threat of grades is not how education works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Such a system of punishment can only create a situation<br>where students don't want to go to school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Creating a myth,<br>that children must be taught.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make schools about wisdom and success,<br>and the students will learn on their own.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea of graduation is a terrible insult,<br>in reality knowledge is not divided into levels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In reality,<br>education is never ending.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is about Adventures and Investigations,<br>there is no punishment here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failure to accomplish something does not result in a failing grade,<br>but rather, becomes a delicious new challenge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pursuit of one's many curiosities,<br>creates a much broader landscape of knowledge.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Given room to think and dream,<br>without a threat of failure of punishment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students will self assemble,<br>structuring a school that matches the need of the current generation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not grades, but wisdom,<br>that should serve as the encouragement and reward.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom that old art of seeing,<br>wisdom the pathway to greatness, peace, and unity.</div>
