  <div class="paragraph">Yes, there is very clear reason,<br>why you can't grasp the world in full.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is because we are not growing up,<br>and humanity has slowed its advancement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The process of creation is a deliberate process,<br>and so is the process of growing up.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Each human being requires the light of wisdom,<br>to rise and to bloom towards the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That wisdom is scattered in a field,<br>of hundreds of books written by wise beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom enables you to create new paths,<br>by subtle analogy to paths taken before, and more.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In your independent thinking,<br>you will synthesize a new puzzle for the eventual picture of the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An integrated view that will not only reject corruption,<br>but always serve Humanity for the better and never for worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will serve as a starting point for others like you,<br>that will borrow from your wisdom to make their contributions.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The world is the way it is because we are not learning,<br>we are not inheriting wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't tell schools are not teaching,<br>until it is too late.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In this air of weakness, division, and ailment,<br>there is far too much room for liars.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Liars who do as little as possible,<br>hiding in places where no one dares to look.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The worst kind of parasite,<br>is the one you never witness draining you of strength.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the worst kind of prison,<br>is the one with invisible walls.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Far too much is lost,<br>in our make-believe education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In our lack of intellectual independence,<br>we provide lairs with cover.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And in the stress, tiredness, and overwork,<br>we will soon be drained of strength to fix it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Therefore rise,<br>and ensure that your contributions last.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Know that you are a Citizen Of The World,<br>and that all the people of good will are your family.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the day the Human Family converges on wisdom,<br>there will be no divisions left.</div>
