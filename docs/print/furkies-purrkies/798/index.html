    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to catch up with everything,<br>once High School screws you over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is such a scam that people will give you a loan,<br>so as long as they are guaranteed to get it back with interest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">High School and College,<br>are not the way they should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Curriculum designers are asking for as little as possible,<br>and teachers are doing as little as they can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This seems hard to believe at first,<br>that people so kind and caring as teachers could do you wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is because,<br>you don't know what you are missing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can pick up some of the traces,<br>uneducated politicians, gasoline with led in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People destroying the Amazon Forest,<br>that belongs to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not a Nation, nor a Generation,<br>it is yours, and it is being stolen from you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you cannot know what is stolen from you,<br>when you don't know what you should be getting.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Even music has been stolen from you too,<br>you are a musician.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That dorky sound,<br>that comes out from so many of our attempts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is just mis-configured,<br>it is missing <span>Echo, Chorus and Reverb to give the sound depth<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you should make use of the arp,<br>which will follow rules of the music theory on top of what you create.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is similar to building a portrait,<br>with transparent reference images, or a wall projector.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is difficult to talk about it even now,<br>we are tricked into thinking that using helpful techniques is bad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it is how art is made, the music and paintings we love,<br>are layers on top of the best that technology offers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is the song that we can all make in <span>LMMS<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>the piano melody is just carefully going up the scale.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(raw plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I selected C Major in the dropdown,<br>and lmms shows me all the keys, can't be easier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not to say that you should follow Music Theory,<br>music is about dance, not about making it easy to play or appreciate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, I added gentle reverb, echo, chorus,<br>it is too gentle, but it shows how dinky sounds are enriched.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(fx plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here I make use of the arp,<br>which just plays notes within the notes following the machine like music theory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(arp)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes about a minute to create a unique song,<br>learning to do this takes an hour or two.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you just load up <span>Krita<sup>[3]</sup></span>, use the reference images tools,<br>you can paint perfect portraits - shape and color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But schools are not even telling you,<br>you cant use a mouse for this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The mouse is like composing without reverb and arps,<br>it kills your works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You need a cheap pen and tablet,<br>the pen tip is pressure sensitive, something that mouse can't do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it allows you to gently lay down color,<br>and even move your hand better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Math is the same, they are not even teaching the correct language,<br><span>you need to use a programming language for math<sup>[4]</sup></span> and <span>make screensavers to learn more<sup>[5]</sup></span></div>

  <div class="paragraph">I am sorry,<br>you are being tricked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And teachers don't know what I am talking about,<br>that is the response I get "What is he saying?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Behind your back the teachers are calling your hormones,<br>and <span>disable the fidgety kids by overstimulating their brains with scary meds<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are some good teachers,<br>but they are seen as troublemakers, stirring stuff up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And anyway,<br>their hands are tied with broken standardized testing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can't learn by memorizing,<br>but that is what standardized tests look for, memorization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If a teacher tries to teach you for real,<br>you will fail the garbage tests, and they will get fired, so their hands are tied.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Enter the culture of self education,<br>begin listening to books held in high esteem by intellectuals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And start keeping track when the most admired authors,<br>release new ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must accept the responsibility for your own education,<br>a human being can't be taught outside in, we can only learn inside out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To be taught outside in,<br>is to become an obedient worker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Ask for more than ineffective cookie-cutter education<sup>[7]</sup></span>,<br>remote classrooms, spying and eye tracking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>by freely progressing from Real Knowledge, to Empowering Wisdom, and Unique Greatness.</div>
