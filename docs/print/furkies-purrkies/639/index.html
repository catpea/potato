      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Art And Projectors</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was little I had a portrait drawn of me,<br>and though it was very nice it didn't capture my face exactly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am not complaining,<br>I am just saying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why I emphasize the need for projectors,<br>and there are three types of projectors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A low tech light bulb, mirror and lens thing,<br>that is perfectly built for projecting a photograph an a wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The standard office or home projector,<br>used for presentations and watching movies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And and pico projector,<br>one that plugs into your phone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you have good portrait photos,<br>and you don't want to use your projector too much.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get the low tech one, they are very inexpensive,<br>but remember your photograph needs to be good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For comfort, get a home or office projector,<br>these are the brightest and have the highest resolutions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pico projectors work just fine,<br>but they are not as bright, you will need to use it at night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The big deal about digital projectors,<br>is that you can edit the photo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cropping your source image is a big deal,<br>and so is adjusting brightness and contrast.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But by far the most useful computer trick,<br>is lowering the number of colors in your photo, often called posterize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will help you see where,<br>and WHAT! the shadows really look like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A face is not an oval with a nose,<br>it is composed out of layers of shadows, basically.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you can see where the shadows start and end,<br>deepen and lighten...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...you can then capture the soul,<br>of the person you are drawing or painting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Start with pencils, and blending stumps,<br>art pencils have a range of useful tones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But try painting on canvas as well,<br>or wood panes from a local hardware store.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing to stop you from becoming an artist now,<br>but there is one more big step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to exhibit your art,<br>business offices, coffee shops, galleries and shows at the local museum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you asking what is the point,<br>the point is a taste of greatness you get at your first big show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, your show is also your guide,<br>when you feel that you have finished...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You may ask your self,<br>is this good enough for the gallery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this may lead you to realize,<br>that the darker side of the person's face you just painted, feels empty, because it was just a shadow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to re-shoot the photo,<br>with the person having sparkling water droplets on their face,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn to paint them,<br>and add them in to your painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you take a source photo,<br>you will now ask yourself: "Is this good enough for a painting I can exhibit at a show."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is there too much of a flat area,<br>should I return in the morning, when the sun passes through the currently flat trees."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will find your own way,<br>for example in conquering color mixing; you may pick blue for the next 20 paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People will call it your blue phase,<br>when you understand blue you may add red and that may become a topic for another exhibition.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At some point you will also begin mixing and composing,<br>adding butterflies, castles, werewolves, or a sky from a different planet in the background.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something interesting will call to you,<br>and the theme will become your friend, and part of your style.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I will close with a silly warning,<br>I am a fan Perrier the sparkling water.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while having a sip of the bubbly thing,<br>I noticed that my four foot rectangular canvas was perfect for a small bottle of Perrier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I really enjoyed painting it,<br>and the color was just perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However, when I exhibited my art, some fiend, scribbled,<br>"Andy Warhol" on the paper label beneath my painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I thought of his can of Campbell's piece, and immediately googled Warhol and Perrier,<br><span>whoopsie, I was not the first to frame a bottle of Perrier<sup>[1]</sup></span> - lesson learned.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Make an art out of finding amazing things to draw and paint,<br>dive deeply to create both memorable photographs, and paintings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And make sure you create enough artworks to fill a coffee-table book,<br>or an art manual where you can show your process, sketches, and photos too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, don't be a chapter,<br>fill the entire book.</div>
