  <div class="paragraph">As the inventor in me purrs along,<br>pondering a little song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am inventing new thingamabobs,<br>and redesigning all my door knobs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I must say, the wallet design number 40,<br>is starting to look pretty sporty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Design is extremely technical,<br>but comes out looking tactical.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this little song of mine,<br>is going to have an amazing baseline.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As I broke new grounds,<br>by inventing all kinds of new sounds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went around my house,<br>tapping at things at if to scare a mouse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am getting ready to record my own drumkit,<br>so I am searching for all the sounds I can emit.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the programming universe,<br>I am building a new world anybody can traverse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went back to the old idea of <span>MUD<sup>[1]</sup></span> and <span>MOO<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>to create a text world anybody can venture to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I merged it with WikiWiki,<br>to create a program that isn't very picky.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To traverse the world,<br>the user has to carefully read what they are told.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will have to conquer many puzzles and quests,<br>though there will not be any tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While this is still a tiny research tool,<br>maybe someday it could become a school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a million things I would like to do,<br>but I can only pick a few.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am really excited about jogging in cold weather,<br>when running on snow I feel like a feather.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there are only 71 days until the of winter,<br>so I better learn to shuffle like a sprinter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Life truly is plenty long, that is for sure,<br>but we should take care of our inventions until they mature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As inventing and thinking up new things,<br>gives our imagination wings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not so much about the invention it self,<br>after all it is just going to sit on the shelf.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What it is truly about,<br>is eliminating inventor's doubt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because the truth is, <strong>we are all inventors</strong>,<br>and we don't even need slowpoke mentors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all have plenty of ideas on our own,<br>and we are <strong>always</strong> in the zone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just start with a single brick,<br>and make sure that the next one will stick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Next thing you know you have a brand new thingamajig,<br>and a new invention, is <strong>always</strong> big.</div>
