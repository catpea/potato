  <div class="paragraph">I know it is hard to keep track of things,<br>especially as people age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So this is a quick reminder,<br>the children remember each and every time you lie to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The way you used to remember,<br>and try to understand why.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Except, somehow, the children born to a more connected world,<br>become smarter, they are a lot, smarter than you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even with all the lies,<br>greed and <span>rockets<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The kids are making, fun of you, all of you<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br><span>they called you and your stupid ideas, out, long ago<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And they laugh hard, like only a child can<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>canceling your own civil and human rights, really makes the laugh.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Any time you lie to your classroom,<br>or your own children, they f****g know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you manage to sneak a lie past them,<br>then that is only because they lack some quantum of experience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They'll call you out in a mater of days,<br>and just for sneaking one past them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They'll call you out on your inability to stop overeating,<br>or how you breath smells like alcohol.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or what a loser thing it is to say to your boy,<br>the dumb shit you were spoon fed about becoming a man.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We know you are tolerating broken schools,<br>because it s convenient for you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And because you have aged, but did not yet become mature enough,<br>to see how horrible that is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those of you who are teachers,<br>let me remind you, what it was like back in the student days.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We didn't come to school to learn,<br>we came to school to test the teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To see if you are worthy of teaching us,<br>to see if they have anything worth the while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But they did not, because anything they were peddling,<br>we could learn on our own a 1,000 times faster.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We tricked teachers that we were performing,<br>as they fudged the grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We were not hormones, or dead ends, or losers,<br>the f****g teachers were always the losers, and the sellouts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I dropped out of high school,<br>because the biology teacher said weed is an herb and the math teacher was a pervert.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't go to the guidance counselor for guidance,<br>I went to see a washed up man pretending that he is working.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get as big of a picture as I can,<br>of all the people I didn't want to become later in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When I dropped out of college,<br>it was to celebrate real Knowledge and Real Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We called you out on everything,<br>and to get what is owed to us, we found ways to self educate and rise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world does not belong to the ghouls, pill poppers and pretenders,<br>it belongs to the children.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more connected the younger generations become,<br>the faster they will become smarter than you, and by that I mean all of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The combination of climate change,<br>nuclear threat and increased world connectivity and access to real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will make ti so that the children will not let you lie,<br>or make a fool of yourselves, much longer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mark my words, as desperate as you may be for a break, or change, for the lessening of your responsibilities,<br>as a teacher, or a father, or a mother - you do not want to be branded as a traitor to your own children.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is true for us all that we require proper education,<br>so show your children that you give a shit to live another 30 years by repairing you body, and making your diet and exercise work this time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Show them, that you are willing to learn, by taking to audio books...<br>held in high esteem by sane and well educated people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for your own sake, before you lie to your child or children,<br>think twice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because if you are the kind of person, that does not treat children with utmost respect,<br>then they will certainly become the kind of person, that will make you learn form your own god damn mistakes in your old age.</div>
