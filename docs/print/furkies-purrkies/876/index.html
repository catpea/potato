      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The World May Stand Still; Or, The Importance Of Real Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those who stand against,<br>the advancement of humanity are just liars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars, who discovered an easy way up,<br>that quite often requires that they lie to themselves too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A blind belief is not an honorable thing,<br>it is a lie, a self lie, an un-examined life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To vote against goodness, progress,<br>and Human Rights...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Means to gang up,<br>with those who hate change...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who have something to lose,<br>if the world shifts towards goodness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Usually that is a enormous group of people,<br>that the liars spent their life carefully manipulating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This easy way up,<br>makes it self up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It simply revolves, around the blind opposite,<br>of what the educated people do, or vote on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A lot of scientific research,<br>is fake, and experiments can't be recreated with the same results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here people only acted like real scientists,<br>their Ph.D's are utterly worthless, a stain on their wall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The liars, exploit all the goodness that comes their way,<br>they blindly feed on anything and everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Liars seek compromises,<br>knowing they always win when they get them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has been said, in a compromise between good and evil,<br>evil can only gains, and goodness can only lose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, there is no position against Human Development<br>nothing there to stand on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no future there,<br>no education, no peace, no reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People are simply opposing,<br>reason, goodness and improvement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They just stand in blind opposition,<br>no-thinking, no-future, just-the-moment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No long term plans here either,<br>nor will you ever find clear motives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Deaf, dumb, and blind, opposition,<br>with some crazy extras glued on to attract more followers...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is not a strategy based on reason,<br>and thus goes nowhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing that can be done<br>to vote liars out once they gain positions of power.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can only wait them out,<br>and the price for waiting is great.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity will simply not advance,<br>but stand still - blind-veto, by blind-veto.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this time standing still, can be spend,<br>on ensuring that the younger generations have real schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That they receive real education,<br>that produces life long results.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That every class ends<br>in a powerful, impressive, and meaningful, new talent,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just teaching disconnected things,<br>is too easy to fake, is too easy to betray the students with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If it is yet to connect, or does not connect,<br>then the lecture is simply fake, filled with nonsence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for every professor to disagree with me here,<br>going over the materials is not teaching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Retest all your graduates,<br>high school on up, and reproduce their research - then you'll know how right you are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May the grasp that liars have on humanity remind us that,<br>only the well educated; in real schools that provide real results ...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only those with Dignity, Long Vision, and Authenticity,<br>can have the privilege of representing large groups of people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If a candidate does not have powerful books that change lives,<br>then they are not grown up enough, to do grown up things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our funding of ineffective schools that sell students out,<br>for unforgivable college loans, came with a great price.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the lesson is that a nation must first and foremost,<br>learn to think clearly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Arrange for real education,<br>and put an end to poverty...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that people have the peace of mind,<br><strong>necessary</strong> for real education...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And hold up reality, reason and wisdom,<br>as the highest values.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not to cling to the past, or let liars convince us how expert they are,<br>as that will only add to overpopulation concerns, and climate, and nuclear threats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are to strive for real education,<br>with eyes on the future, as that is the only thing that will help us see clearly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, we are to grow all the way up,<br>until we each become a great being.</div>
