    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must try to be cheerful and funny,<br>especially when the weather outside is not sunny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to take care of our joy,<br>no matter what it is that is trying to annoy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And foolishness is an absolute must,<br>though as we grow it is something we refine and adjust.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even silly meanderings from place to place,<br>are to be practiced daily at a reasonable pace.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not as silly as it seems,<br>for one it helps us with our dreams.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We may even wake up with a little smile,<br>knowing out dreams were worth the while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it gets even more complicated than that,<br>because we also need a place to write poetry at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect people only like poetry that is funny,<br>so it is up to us to make our days sunny.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And as you can imagine with poetry comes art,<br>painting is something that is nearest the heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Painting truly shows the difference between sad and funny,<br>the difference is uncanny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We don't have to choose to paint a silly bunny,<br>just a portrait of someone trying to be funny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And with a projector you can create instant art,<br>it just takes a silly photo to start.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Composing music with lmms,<br>will push back the stress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning programming generative art,<br>will make you feel pretty smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then love of wisdom will call to you,<br>the old philosophers always come through.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will remind you that strength must come first,<br>and that our frowns need to be reversed.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The philosophers teach us how to laugh for real,<br>and they show us that it is a big deal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I don't think anyone can explain very well,<br>silliness and love of life is something that helps us out of our shell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It starts with the choice to face life with a smile,<br>and than always traveling that extra mile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The things we create remind us that life is not a race,<br>and make the universe a more beautiful place.</div>
