    </div>

  <div class="paragraph">I was getting around to painting my favorite gym photo,<br>but I still had a problem with painting eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I felt like I needed one more practice test,<br>I remembered "Reddit Gets Drawn" from my days of I will never draw like that...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And while I am not a fan of social media,<br>there was a photo with good eyes I could practice on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure the internet stranger I painted,<br>will like it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was a very fun, but also exhausting challenge,<br>it probably took six or eight hours, and I had to get everything perfect in a single sitting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">The color palette approach, that I am just going to call Cat Pea Technique,<br>to keep things simple, worked flawlessly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did pre-process the image in GIMP,<br>enraging the eyes, making the mouth smaller, and above all to get a preview.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a very rough sketch,<br>it took 10 minutes, it had double eyebrows, things were overlapping...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it was perfect,<br>it delivered, a preview, a rough outline of where the eyes, nose, ear, lips need to be; and of course; the color map.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You just can't go wrong,<br>when you already have everything as you start painting.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You know something, I did not outline things,<br>in the beginning, like in that ancient video from 1995 that I remember so vividly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The person just did big blobs of paint,<br>I think they were using a reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect everyone maybe doing it,<br>I wish this was more well known.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is so sad that there are people out there,<br>who tried digital painting, and gave up, because they didn't know to stretch the reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Both for color,<br>and proportions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did solve the eye problem, I was stylizing them too much,<br>I can't just cut out a circle to make an iris - I needed to do it freehand, with an airbrush, like a landscape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The uncanny valley effect was caused by perfection in the eyes,<br>paintings are meant to be flawed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>You can see the perfect imperfections in the final image<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>that I linked to <span>in my Reddit Gets Drawn post<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Finally, <span>this also marks my first Time-lapse painting video<sup>[3]</sup></span>,<br>this was on my todo since I was a teenager.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">You can do this too, Art is for all now,<br>we are all artists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need hand eye coordination,<br>you don't need to use grids, just stretch out the reference image over your entire canvas, and set opacity to 50% and start painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you get all the big blobs of paint in,<br>once you have your eyes, iris, eyelids, nose highlights and nose holes, upper lip, the dividing shadow, lower lip.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you stop needing positioning information,<br>then drop the opacity of your reference image to 1%.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At 1% it is invisible to you,<br>but it will still respond to your color picker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as you do eyelid details, you just click the color picker in an era that feel wrong to you,<br>and you will get the color from the reference image - you will get the color that you should use for that spot.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I wish you didn't have to get a Pen and Tablet,<br>because $40 bucks is still $40 bucks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the pressure sensor at the tip of the pen,<br>will let you slowly apply the color.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The mouse will just dump it in there,<br>but if you press gently with the pen, you will slowly apply the color - that is the painting part.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is also why it is not paint by number,<br>because you are still using your heart, stylizing how much color you want in there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you have the tablet and pen,<br>Krita the professional painting program is free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it does represent a job,<br>you are training yourself how to be a graphic designer, digital artist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If art call to you, <span>begin taking Krita Tutorials as soon as you order the tablet<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br>it is not a very difficult program - you only use five key combinations, if even that, mostly brush, eraser, merge layer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Digital painting is for all, it loves all, but don't use a mouse, get a cheap pen and tablet,<br>and times have changed, technology made it so, that we are all artists now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The entry barrier of shape and color,<br>that kept so many of us away, has fallen now - you are an artist.</div>
