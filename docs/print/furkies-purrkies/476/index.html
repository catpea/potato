      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Super Smart</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are absolutely a genius,<br>and your mind knows no limits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People that end up creating marvels,<br>simply grow, and cannot help but to grow unique.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all have some personified idea of genius,<br>Einstein, Socrates, Leonardo DaVinci, Giordano Bruno, Newton.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we each have to look closer at their achievements,<br>we have to notice that they grow, build.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They create new unique things,<br>on top of the things they have previously arrived at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The process by which they arrive at things,<br>is not a forced process, they don't create new things by being pushed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They arrive at new things by following their curiosities,<br>by dancing through different subjects, with great pleasure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you let people push you into subjects you are not ready for,<br>you will fail, because you are either not ready, or not interested.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The motion between our curiosities and subjects of interest,<br>is a sacred motion, our most beautiful adventure, and it must be connected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has to stretch from childhood to our greatest age,<br>our curiosities are an expression of who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And there is no such thing as a silly interest or hobby,<br>it is always a powerful stepping stone that will reinforce a greater pursuit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we are shamed out of a hobby, or forced to follow some preset subject,<br>we are pushed onto a path that can only lead to misery and failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those students that were tricked or mis-inspired to become dentists, lawyers, and doctors,<br>are now in danger of overwork, mental disorders and illness, self medication and falling apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can handle it, but it is unlikely that they are on their path,<br>nor could they guess or voice what they path should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because their path of unique genius,<br>lies cold and undiscovered.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not a matter of handling it, or kind of enjoying it,<br>it is a matter of becoming a great being and changing the world for better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our gentle and beautiful road of tiny curiosities must be followed,<br>what calls to us, becomes natural to us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What takes many steps to some,<br>takes but one to those who are ready for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Deep within our delicate minds,<br>lie star charts of questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they gently call out to us,<br>for answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to answer,<br>because when lines connect they make a constellation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when constellations connect,<br>it makes all the difference.</div>
