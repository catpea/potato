      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Authorities Serve Not Their Nations But The Future Generations</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will all start with a young lady <span>tracking the loss of species<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>and keeping an eye on the climate - and what we are doing about both.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To put it bluntly,<br>she will say “That’s F-ing Enough.”</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is not an ordinary F-word,<br>this phrase once uttered, is a dreadful phrase.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As it creates a crease,<br>a separation between generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The students understand the urgency of the situation,<br>better than us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is a lot of students,<br>in the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But they still need our help with the fundamentals,<br>as those fall under indoctrination and are harder to see than climate and loss of species.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes a classroom to list all the problems in one go,<br>while the following list is short, it is worded differently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where the Great Michele Alexander may say,<br>“we must put an end to the disproportionate mass incarceration”, the children will make a shorter version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No more prisons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is the crease, the separation, they will not be seeking congress, they will not look to make connections,<br>the emperor will be naked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So it is is not just climate change and loss of species, you see,<br>they will have enough of all the liars and half measures, and deals and delays.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I like to think of these as new amendments to the constitutions,<br>all around the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">28th Amendment will just have three words,<br>No more prisons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 29th Amendment, also three words,<br>No more poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 30th amendment, very noble,<br>A politician or any kind, including Representatives and Congress People,<br>will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This one inspired by the Cadet Honor Code at West Point,<br>and makes false promises and lying a punishable offense under the new criminal justice system, a minimum of 50 years of meaningful daily community service.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 31st amendment will address war, and it is just three words again,<br>No More Killing</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the 32 amendment, will make all government employees earn at most minimum wage,<br>as any politician will surely admit it was never about the money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 33rd amendment,<br>will shut down all educational institutions that fail to provide results,<br>based on evaluating student success in real life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children will spend entire semesters drafting amendments,<br>a lot of them will not pass at the moment of writing, due to psychological limitations of the drafty emperors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course, this will not be a problem,<br>for <em>they are</em> the soon to be the new Representatives and Congressmen, Presidents, and Prime Ministers.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It will be up to the politicians to implement the end of poverty,<br>it is rather easy, food-medical-educational-housing-need charges will always process through, though the governments will haggle like hell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The challenge will be in making these changes global,<br>and the uniformity of this wiser system will encourage limitations.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be a little more than a single point that needs to be made,<br>to clean up the plastics. For every new kilogram of plastic, ten kilograms must be scooped up out of dumps, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an easy cleanup system,<br>it is very challenging to the industries that caused the pollution - the children will love that.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With the end of poverty and birth of effective education, there will be little that can’t be done,<br>and smart money that evaluates the purchases as they are made will ensuring economic stability.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Climate change and loss of species are already presenting clear evidence,<br>and will prove that the emperor is naked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To upset the younger generations this way,<br>is to unravel the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We had an opportunity to elect the correct president in US,<br>but people were simply too uneducated and thus mislead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not their fault, the schools have never become,<br>what the promise of schools hinted on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if elected four or eight years of educated policy making whilst hoping that the world will follow,<br>that was far too little.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The chance we had, requited a lot of change, a lot of work,<br>we didn't stand a chance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How many adults don’t laugh at free home and money,<br>under a Strong Universal Income Plan... it is almost funny to ask isn’t it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine a life without wage slavery,<br>a world of well educated voters.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A world where a teacher in their Dignity,<br>will not lower quality of lectures, to increase their work performance score.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sleepy Humanity needed to witness climate change and loss of species,<br>including soon to be lost Tigers and Orangutans, to see that the politicians were as ineffective as the schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hence the three dreadful words,<br>in the opening of the poem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That mark the separation between generations,<br>and the mach of children and students at capitols.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to help them understand that existence of prisons and poverty is a mistake,<br>we have to help them associate it with the mistake of war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to help them see, that we made many mistakes, not just climate change and loss of species,<br>they have to upgrade the way money works, and the way we grow up - crime is meant to be prevented, prisons only cause greater harm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to show that the civilization they are born into is young,<br>that everyone of them must contribute some change for better, as they each grow in kindness, knowledge, compassion, wisdom, greatness and vision.</div>
