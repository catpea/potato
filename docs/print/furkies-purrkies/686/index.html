  <div class="paragraph">In the beginning find your own self,<br>remember to be the Elf and not the shelf.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't just instantly run out the door,<br>don't go sky diving, do something you adore.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Try fighting Matadors,<br>and tearing open the stable doors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Save oppressed creatures,<br>maybe unleash them to become teachers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, just hit the Appalachian Trail,<br>and return with a manuscript of a marvelous tail.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do things that that you move you,<br>that upon completion expand your view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are young the aim is to rise,<br>and not all things need be wise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can even be artistic and somewhat obscene,<br>chalk London with curse words and make a big scene.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as you don't get caught and the chalk comes from the White Cliffs of Dover,<br>you'll become as famous as <span>Banksy<sup>[1]</sup></span> before it is over.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Read many books on your way to your middle age,<br>and wisdom will take the center stage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your beautifully foolish Guerrilla Art,<br>will transform into many things that are very smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stay on the trails,<br>and bring back many tales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pacific Crest Trail is great for growing wise,<br>all those sunsets make for beautiful skies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is about a strong connection,<br>and a single Human direction.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When wisdom fills your middle life,<br>in your golden age, it will cut through questions like a knife.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Golden Age is where things get really fun,<br>you have to reverse-shoplift all your books one by one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visit every big library in Europe to plant your books,..<br>dress like a librarian and blend-in with your good looks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that you sail most of the seas,<br>and enjoy the fragrant breeze.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If I may, eat a fried European flounder on a stick,<br>the salt of the Baltic Sea gives it a fiiine kick.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Update the best wisdom of your generation,<br>and help the little ones with cogitation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And please,<br>make sure they know to walk the trials and hit the seas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to help the little ones begin at the best places,<br>there must never be an end to smiling faces.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We cant just make a rules out of thin air,<br>and then force everyone to care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pushing young people into work and office, and career and stress,<br>only hurts them and creates a mess.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need time and wisdom to see the world for what it is,<br>life is a big deal, not some multiple answer quiz.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human Beings must be allowed to flourish and transcend,<br>that is how we can guarantee that Humanity never meets its end.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A life well lived is marked by Cheerful Creativity, Beautiful Wisdom, and Lasting Greatness,<br>as it all adds up to create Profound Completeness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what a gift and inspiration a narrated book about such a life,<br>and how precious the wisdom that helps to avoid strife.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Surely, this is but one of countless ways to live well,<br>but we mustn't stay in our shell, nor aim for a cubicle or some other cell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Life is meant to be A Beautiful Work Of Art,<br>it is not a machine but a beating heart.</div>
