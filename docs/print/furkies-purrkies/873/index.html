  <div class="paragraph">If you ask someone,<br>about math or physics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How it is it, that they have learned,<br>but they don’t know it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will not be able,<br>to give you a very clear answer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is exactly what you would expect,<br>from being fooled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">“I took physics”, “but I don’t know physics”,<br>“it must be my fault”.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not,<br>their fault.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just that,<br>whatever teachers were doing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or whatever they themselves,<br>were tricked into doing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Was not teaching,<br>but forcing people to perform.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most often,<br>by means of temporary memorization.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If teachers question,<br>this method of education...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Students will fail State tests,<br>and school will be shut down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone will be bussed to a school,<br>that does not question the way things are.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to do two things,<br>from now on, question everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Become a scientist by day,<br>and a News Reporter by night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Start by questioning everything I said in here,<br>and move on to schools - which brings us to the second thing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are being easily manipulated,<br>because you are letting everyone define what a school is, as it serves <strong>them</strong> best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The closest you can get to it,<br>is watching the school Hackers learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They have it totally figured out,<br>though they are hyper-mastering a single branch of the tree.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Honestly, so as long as they have dignity and manners,<br>this is neither good nor bad.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">What you maybe interested in however,<br>is the full picture.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I owe you, an explanation that fits a single paragraph,<br>as those are most often the honest ones.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">My somewhat gloomy definition,<br>is as follows:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">“A real school and by extension teachers and education,<br>enables students to flourish, if they have to build or rebuild their community from ground up.”</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hackers are such a good example,<br>because they could rebuild communication, and write whatever software is needed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though programming is extremely abstract,<br>as abstract as screensavers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hackers know it from beginning to end,<br>they have no issue with practical applications.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no class called hacking,<br>they have tho take networking, programming, soldering, and very often art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there should be,<br>this class should be called Creative Engineering.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A real school would have all other subjects clustered,<br>and mutually reinforced this way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching a disconnected fragments that can't help you build or create,<br>is how schools get away with fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Afterword,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, I would like to underline that,<br>once poor children were thought of as unteachable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Back then they would often be employed in mines,<br>because they can fit smaller passageways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today, rather than employing children in a mine,<br>we are mining students as a resource.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are a source of cheap labor, minimum wage,<br>and a tool that despite ineffective education powers unforgivable college loans.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than letting the businessmen learn a lesson from handing out high risk loans,<br>we instead forcibly extract the payment from student paychecks, later in their life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Loans unforgivable by bankruptcy,<br>handed out to trusting and unsuspecting young people.</div>
