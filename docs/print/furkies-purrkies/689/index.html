    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One moment you're merely curious about silly art,<br>and the next you are a Pop Surrealist for life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only do your paintings call to you,<br>but the galleries can't stop calling too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No art more fascinating than Low Brow Art,<br>has been invented, because no such thing can be invented.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mona Lisa is nice,<br>but a cat staring into your soul is irresistible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is something even more,<br>than the Humor and Fascination that Lowbrow represents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It teaches you to become an artist,<br>it only asks three things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Make a funny doodle,<br>make it a silly animal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Color your doodle,<br>be mindful of shadows, and highlights.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And bring out the big guns,<br>reference photos of real things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of silliness,<br>in bringing a dollop realism to doodles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Upgrade the googly eyes in your doodle,<br>with eyes that aim for realism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we learn to paint realistic portraits,<br>failing to get things right is frustrating.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But in the happy world of Pop Surrealism,<br>all kinds of works are welcome.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You get to practice and learn while have fun,<br>a lot of fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing in the world of Pop Surrealism feels wrong,<br>everything is happy, and always makes strangers smile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Could you imagine a more loving teacher?<br>probably not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is more to it,<br>because Pop Surrealism does not want you to stop having fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After you get your doodle finished up,<br>you will feel encouraged, to pop a fishbowl over its head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And begin painting the strange planet that your doodle,<br>is cheerfully prancing about.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In ordinary art,<br>when you finish you are done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In Low Brow,<br>each time you finish it is a new beginning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That,<br>is the nature of surrealism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, while in the real world,<br>you eventually run out of canvas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the computer world you re-size it,<br>to make room for more fascinating stuff.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every extension in your painting is a masterpiece, in it self,<br>and deserves a stack of stickers, a mug, and some T-shirts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By the time you exhibit,<br>you created a mythology of an entire population of creatures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything and everyone will love you in the world of Pop Surrealism,<br>no one will be able to put down your Art Book until they see it all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Merely practicing art is a terrible idea,<br>as at the end of the day all we have is unfinished scraps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the fantastic world of pop surrealism,<br>what you end up with at the end of the day, is a fascinating work of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A work of art that is sure,<br>to make someone smile.</div>
