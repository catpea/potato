    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">(La Liberté Éclairant Le Monde is French for Liberty Enlightening the World)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is unclear if parents understand the way children do,<br>it may not be the blight of indoctrination alone that holds us back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe that children are so much smarter,<br>and parents so burdened with poverty and confusion, that <strong>everything</strong> is lost in translation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parents know schools are broken, they know their grades were fake,<br>and yet, in their slumber, they send their children towards the same things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children eventually let go of their intelligence, brilliance, and genius,<br>because they can see it interferes with grades, and may even cause <span>dread (TRIGGER WARNING)<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every child is a genius, even if that wasn't true - which it is,<br>there are infinite ways to get at science or music composition, and leadership, or entrepreneurship.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are extremely adaptive,<br>we are not rocks thrown into water.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, if we are taught that reality is something other than it really is,<br>then the sacred space in which we do our decision making is - violated, and we become hijacked, and it becomes unstable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I always had trouble understanding how someone can cause harm, or commit a crime,<br>and I came to conclude that a criminal pulls the trigger for the same reason that soldiers around the world do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their view of reality is often permanently warped,<br>and they are under some pressure, and influence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It could be influence of alcohol or worse,<br>but also it can be the influence of being court marshaled or even yelled at by someone in control of their existence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I immediately realized that criminals are indoctrinated into crime,<br>this religion of crime, is not exactly emergent, it does not exactly come out of nowhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It comes out of poverty, from having parents who drink or do drugs because they can't make their way out of their poverty,<br>and then the threat of the neighborhood bullies, which often, as far as survival goes, means both gangs and the police.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those scary individuals that most people agree to keep in cages,<br>are actually just children who had their minds poisoned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wouldn't say that it is a permanent poisoning,<br>I feel that psychologists know this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they also know that by keeping people in cages,<br>we make them worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I know, that we make ourselves worse for it,<br>a criminal belongs in a Medical Institution specifically built to undo the damage caused by indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Prisons poison the minds of criminals further,<br>what they need is understanding, support, hope, future, - you know real justice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, once they are placed into institutions that aren't sick torture,<br>they may not wish to return to be among the people that did this to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because they will see us ab being indoctrinated into a culture of Retribution and Torture,<br>the criminals that recover, will see the people who were once OK with torturing them as very sick in deed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was always confused about how people can run around with guns, rob apartments, steel cars,<br>I understand what is wrong with them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their minds have been hijacked,<br>they are just victims of indoctrination into the culture of crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Crime is a particularly potent example of the power of indoctrination,<br>which frequently can be explained as "Acting against themselves".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But indoctrination is everywhere,<br>meaning that people are doing things that they think are meaningful, but actually they are just hurting themselves or the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take the other end of the crime spectrum, <span>a cop planting evidence on a known criminal<sup>[2]</sup></span> that should be in jail,<br>the cop was brought up in a culture of putting criminals in cages, the criminal was brought up in a culture of crime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are both wrong, they are both just little spinning tops wound up by their indoctrination,<br>in very desperate need of psychological help, but round and round they go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In a more advanced civilization, all the parties involved here and their families would be relocated,<br>given a bright new start at life, and over and over again, until they became free of their psychological indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their new lives would include expensive housing, free money from an Advanced Universal Income program,<br>and room to take to education, and eventually helping others out of their indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See a primitive civilization punishes,<br>an advanced civilization looks to prevention and therapy - we have a lot of work to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Punishing the police officer would only destabilize them further,<br>and punishing those boys, who already have a stressful and desperate life, suffering addiction, debt, poverty, violence, will certainly make things worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no solution at the level our civilization is currently operating at,<br>the poor boys are suffering the same condition that otherwise reasonable men from Afghanistan who-dont-want-women-in-school are suffering from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their reality is warped, but they are fighting, tooth and nail, like the Great Warriors we all are,<br>except that the warping of their reality is making them hurt themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often self harm becomes apparent, far too late, when one of those boys becomes a father,<br>and watches their son become like they are...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Except now the father gained a grasp on the invisible prison of cultural and psychological indoctrination he was born into,<br>and is now <span>crying that he does not want his son to be like him<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See, once indoctrination is removed, bullies and thugs,<br>will slowly being self repair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Their past life does not stand, in their way towards greatness,<br>we stand in their way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">By sentencing a person stricken by indoctrination into years in prison,<br>we only make things worse, we hurt them further.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I believe it was The Great Michelle Alexander that described a Judge crying,<br>for tearing a family apart, because the father did not break out of his indoctrination fast enough, and ended up being sentenced to prison.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must ask, how can we help these men out of their indoctrination sooner,<br>and eventually we will find that indoctrination is best prevented.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the major components of Prevention,<br>is ending poverty, granting the entire family Access to Free Money, and Advanced Universal Income.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No sum in particular,<br>just a respectful and very generous daily spending limit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This will go a long way, but the process of un-indoctrination,<br>is brittle, requires decades of therapy and re-education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While prevention comes with a clear guarantee,<br>a person already hurt by long therm indoctrination, requires special treatment, preferential treatment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is our misuse of the idea of money, and tolerance of the sick punishment of prisons,<br>that fractures people, that induces the emergence of broken cultures, and repeatedly indoctrinates participants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At this stage of the development of our civilization,<br>Recognition of Indoctrination is the next step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once people being recognizing indoctrination,<br>once they begin seeing its incredible and negative effects on people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will become clear,<br>that changes are required.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first step, that you can take as a Politician, Teacher, or Parent, or Leader, or best yet Writer and Narrator,<br>is simply to explain to children why people do bad things:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They do bad things because the world they think they know is not real,<br>so even though all they are trying to do is good things, like putting food on their table, or keeping their family of neighborhood safe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those things are transformed by the thick layer of the fake reality that is poisoning and suffocating and crushing them,<br>and what looks to them like the right things to do inside their poisoned world, is actually a very bad thing out in our world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here is an opportunity to explain the urgency of real education:<br>so that we don't end up being poisoned and suffocated, and crushed by warped reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We MUST! caution the children about fake or ineffective education,<br>as invisible prison walls are extremely hard to see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to teach the children to get up at the end of class and say:<br>"Hey Ms. Shmumps, but I didn't learn anything in your class today".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to teach them to recognize fake education,<br>and we know what that is like: as many of us graduated without anything to show for it, certainty nothing we couldn't learn on our own in a fraction of the time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Indoctrination is everywhere, most of us were a victim once,<br>be it religions or fake schools, or paid colleges, or military service, or being forced to cleaning gas station toilets as a teenager to make some money.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are ABSOLUTELY not allowed to work jobs like that,<br>if it was their idea tell your parents to do it - you study Art, Music Compositions or Industrial Design, focus on your Portfolio.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>you are always meant to grow up for better, never for the same or worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Indoctrination is both (self) emergent such as we find in high crime neighborhoods,<br>and it is designed such as we find in cults, religions and churches.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pattern is hard to see as it is stretched across life,<br>and it always benefits you a little and it takes a lot in the end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Examples are many,<br>Fraudulent churches around the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Supreme Court rulings protecting parents' right to religion,<br>whilst <span>sacrificing their children's right to reality<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How can we silently tolerate organizations that speak out against reason and fact,<br>to substitute reality with a drugged up version where the good stuff happens after death.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Supreme Court rulings must consider multi-generational impact,<br>the rulings must be made in context of hundreds of years, not in context of browny points.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To be clear, let the adults have their fantasy lifestyles if that is what they want,<br>but don't let them warp the minds of the children by presenting a false reality - and what a truly evil deed that is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, we have ask ourselves if we want leadership,<br>who is not of the mindset that is based on reality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It makes perfect sense for a religious person,<br>to think that a religious father can remove a child from eight grade to teach them more about religion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But a well educated person, who is invested in fact, data, science, evidence,<br>will perceive <span>indoctrinating children into religions as abuse<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The blight of poverty that we drowned the world in,<br>by failing to make money work for us and making it work against us instead, is another kind of emergent indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The modern cultures finally figured out that we are all born equal,<br>and yet we still force children into the poverty of their parents.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is not what equal means, equality means that at birth a child is given enough money,<br>to afford effective tutors that truly teach Knowledge and Wisdom, enough money to own a home, dream about family, and never fear hunger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do. you. not. understand that when you threaten children with military or poverty or some dumb ass idea of hell,<br>they give up their genius - how do you not see that?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education where teachers feed on paychecks like vampires,<br>just to push children to schools that charge even more once they are old enough to work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How can sustaining ineffective education until something is done to fix it,<br>be presented as a justification for propagation of fake schooling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The tolerance of Recruiting soldiers with action-movie like commercials and the promise of free education,<br>among the groups of kids who have not lived long enough to coalesce their knowledge into wisdom is another form of indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Military recruitment to oil machinery of war with minds and bodies,<br>is what real schools and cultures of wisdom were supposed to help us rise from.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A military that takes no interest in helping the world rise out of dark ages,<br>is a military that is not interested in peace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wars cannot be won by waging more wars,<br>not can nations be pacified with propaganda, indoctrination, and fantasies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only wisdom can bring World Peace,<br>only education that truly works, equality that is actually meaningful in context of entire lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know that Narrated Books about real lives and real wisdom of beings who made a positive and lasting impact on the modern world,<br>are a good source of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use the Library, try not to let people make money from the misfortune of fake education,<br>but hurry find your way to thousands of meaningful books, as that is the education that has been denied to us all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">--</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn to recognize Indoctrination,<br>use the idea of indoctrination as a tool to understand broken and often unfixable things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Know, that preventing of fracturing is the noblest way,<br>our civilization must embrace prevention as the most humane way to end mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And above all, break out of whatever invisible walls maybe surrounding you,<br>use it as a key, to set yourself and the world free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become,<br>a Great Being.</div>
