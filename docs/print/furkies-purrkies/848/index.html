  <div class="paragraph">The overwhelming number of liars,<br>makes it so that the world is not led.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world is moving at random,<br>it is all gibberish.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But free and open and wise narrated books,<br>is how the world will be fixed in no time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Books held in high esteem, chapter here, chapter there...<br>have the power to restore minds.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The library children need; to alter the future,<br>must be honest, powerful and authentic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And their classroom must be nature and adventure,<br>not little prison like classrooms, that you yourselves, couldn't wait to get out of.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is plenty of time to make our way towards wisdom,<br>and have the liars run for cover.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is so much time, that you, out of your deepest integrities ,<br>have more than enough time to learn to write a life changing book.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Yes, there are countless ways to share wisdom,<br>but the second to sharing in person, is always, wise books narrated by their authors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let your thoughts add, to create a magnificent treasure, and write it all down,<br>or just grab a microphone, first, and later... write it all down.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you don't know where to start,<br>start with Vonnegut's words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"True terror is to wake up one morning and discover<br>that your high school class is running the country."</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fix High School,<br>so that children are not forced to pretend to learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That there cannot be such a thing as standard education,<br>because a growing minds needs adventure not a brain processing factory.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Maybe start with Rand's shrug,<br>and teach your children to rise, by quoting her book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark,<br>in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let the hero in your soul perish<br>in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world you desire can be won.<br>It exists.. it is real.. it is possible..."</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Quote Thoreau,<br>if Vonnegut and Rand are too modern.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,<br>to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;<br>nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,<br>to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,<br>to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms"</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Quote<br>Whitman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together."</div>
