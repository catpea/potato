    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't hop all the hoops and hope for best,<br>real life is not just another paper test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't go from school to school expecting results,<br>because we can't trust all the adults.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching is a job that puts food on their table,<br>that makes it prone to corruption and unstable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we can't drop out just because,<br>it is not very good to be a mere rebel without a cause.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But above all, teachers and fraud aside,<br>we need to get though all this dignified.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can't just walk into an interview with a diploma,<br>since everybody knows school is broken it will have a certain aroma.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need a real document, documenting real education,<br>something real that will not get lost in translation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That means a real portfolio with real products for sale,<br>a document that proves no matter what, you will prevail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This day and age that often means Design not just scripted tales,<br>but 3D modeling, and printing, and model sales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is called a side gig, a thing you do to stay smart,<br>it is a form of mediation and art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It show that you can dream, design, produce and sell,<br>and all of that looks really well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even though the school is fake as hell,<br>you still need to make a sale.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The state of schools isn't just unfair,<br>but it is an attack and a fraud beyond compare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must not let it ruin your life ahead,<br>you have to replace it and prevent that toxic spread.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You learn on your own and replace it with the real deal,<br>as that is something that the teacher cannot steal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the first year of High School to the last,<br>begin learning computers, 3D modeling and move fast.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your portfolio must be one of a kind,<br>and it has to prove that you are not aiming blind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has to document you rise to brilliance,<br>it has to display your honesty and resilience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It won't guarantee,<br>that you find a good company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it will make everyone one remember you,<br>after each and every interview.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't forget that this is an attack on everyone,<br>every student and human being under the sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe you can start a revolution,<br>and help school authorities to find a real solution.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Otherwise participating in their fraud won't take you far in life,<br>lack of real education really does cut like a knife.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please don't forget that a good job must also be a healthy one,<br>a job that will help us grow in the long run.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, consider building your own business,<br>as that can mean a lot less stress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can carry on learning,<br>while earning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are a genius and you are a creator,<br>within each every one of lives a great innovator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whichever way you go there is something yo should definitely know,<br>learn, learn to no end, wherever you go,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not supposed to go through life nodding and always agreeing,<br>you are meant to become a Great Being.</div>
