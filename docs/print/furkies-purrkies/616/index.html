  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is always close,<br>sometimes as close as a snowflake on your nose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it takes,<br>abut a hundred winter snowflakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And just about as many narrated books at the library,<br>and perhaps a small dictionary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A hundred snowflakes that beautifully branch,<br>is all it takes to start that avalanche.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the first snowflake is right here:<br>you find all your favorite narrated books the first year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one should tell you what book to start with,<br>as finding it will become your favorite story and myth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Half a century from now, come a sunny day,<br>you will say:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(low tone)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A whole month it took,<br>to find my first beloved book".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"At first I had to use a dictionary,<br>and walk uphill, both ways to and fro, the library."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And it snowed,<br>all never slowed."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am not sure what the snowflakes are,<br>but my first snowflake was the word, "Philosopher" and it shone like a star.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It always seemed so magical to me,<br>that I knew that it was a key.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what moved me about Philosophers was how they speak,<br>and that they are timeless and never weak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was never about some system,<br>it was always about their wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was easy to find as they always weave around their best thoughts,<br>so you just need to find the knots.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Over time, I realized that wisdom is everywhere,<br>and finally that it belongs to those who care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is it our right,<br>and it brings us great might.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It enhances the power of introspection and seeing,<br>and calls to us to become a great being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually I was just reading books about life,<br>and yes, they were all about finding wise ways out of strife.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As I realized that the world is not as it looks,<br>I called it: inheriting lifetimes of wisdom from books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And wisdom is in deed the future of Human Kind,<br>as it is the only way with which we can enhance our mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In wisdom we can eliminate poverty with a clever international bank,<br>for which future generations will thank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And only in wisdom will we create rules,<br>that will reshape and fix all the schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is so near,<br>that it is almost already here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All it will take for the world to rise,<br>is to remember the Philosophers and the ways of the wise.</div>
