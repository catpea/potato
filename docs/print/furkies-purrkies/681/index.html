  <div class="paragraph">Your parents should not think of school as a babysitter,<br>they need to care about you learning for real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They should care,<br>if school is working of not.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Merely getting through it,<br>will rob you of knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>You can't really graduate from a broken school<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>real graduation requires real knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the teachers aren't teaching,<br>then like every other person in the world, they can't get paid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cramming is not something you invented,<br>it is something you got manipulated into.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cramming, or any kind of memorization,<br>is not education, it is a trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To know something, requires that you comprehend it,<br><span>that you are able to navigate through the knowledge network within<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This isn't something,<br>that you can sort out later.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People are selling you out for paychecks,<br>they are taking advantage of your lack of experience in life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers are the men who sold the world,<br>one crappy paycheck at a time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This crime is not without consequence,<br><span>Vaccine Hesitancy<sup>[3]</sup></span>, <span>Loss Of Species<sup>[4]</sup></span>, <span>Loss of The Amazon<sup>[5]</sup></span>...</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Climate Change<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br>and even <span>Mass Incarceration<sup>[7]</sup></span> are the result.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Until the world is ready to see that schools are not working,<br>you need to take the responsibility for your own education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has never been more pleasant,<br>Narrated Books, quality Lectures, and enlightening Internet Videos make self education easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you really need to push for it,<br>you need to break away from the Standardized Curriculum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to build your own educational path,<br>in the sequence that matches you best, at the right pace, and driven by your greatest questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is how you build Knowledge Networks,<br>and they function the same way as Memory Palaces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you learn things that are relevant to you,<br>to the best version of your elder self, it stays with you for life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not only that,<br>but the things you learn for real also teach you <strong>how</strong> to think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How to spot liars and manipulators, how to be strong,<br>and how to think like the Great Beings and Authors you admire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you learn for real you don't just walk away with a formula,<br>you make friends across history, you reinvent-along with them in a way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The gravity of theft of real knowledge and proper comprehension,<br>is greater than all the other disaster combined.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because fake education is an attack,<br>an attack that aims to disable you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no conspiracy,<br>the teachers aren't fully aware of what they are doing, their education is fake too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you were to gather all the teachers and principals one in a room,<br>and show them the consequences of their fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All they could say, is,<br>"How were we supposed to know?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They won't even suspect that poverty fractured them,<br>they will swear by their education and paychecks, and experience.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education the world can't even see,<br>the invisible toxic prison walls of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education,<br>We can't grow out of our mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The World is asking you,<br>and your generation to become Great Beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the world learn for real,<br>and understand, and comprehend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of teachers,<br>you must become a teacher.</div>
