      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">High School 101: Building Your Own Secret Laboratory</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">High School does not teach very much,<br>but it is going to be OK so as long as you learn on your own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you are still looking for a direction,<br><span>consider creating a mighty industrial design portfolio<sup>[1]</sup></span>, use <span>Blender<sup>[2]</sup></span> and <span>Ender<sup>[3]</sup></span> to learn 3D Modeling, Printing, and real product design.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning on your own is always about the next complex cluster of things,<br>that you find interesting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Examples of a couple of clusters that I like are,<br>Computer Generated Art and Programming, Electronics + DIY Flying Drones and possibly programming them as well, and Learning art and color mixing with the use of Office Projectors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Clusters are always friendly, they are full of color, and you never memorize, ever,<br>and each cluster is incredibly fascinating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don’t expect a school that takes money from you to teach you anything,<br>and don’t let anybody tell you what to learn, as that is a fake education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It takes us a long time to build up the roads, and connect the dots,<br>to get into a cluster of subjects that we can be passionate about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being force fed information via a standardized curriculum or lecture plan,<br>is an unbelievable insult, it is fraud, and it is rage worthy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Something went wrong<sup>[4]</sup></span>,<br><span>the adults of some authority go bonkers<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>But as long as you learn for real be it failure or triumph<sup>[6]</sup></span>,<br><span>you will do well<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was always kind of silly to think that somebody else will give you,<br>a job, money, home, health, happiness, and perfect life - in a world of tricksters and liars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is so much more meaningful, to do it yourself,<br>that all those lies don’t even mater.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But don’t allow yourself to just believe in what people are telling you, including me,<br>all the observations, and promises that people are making, require proper evidence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Evidence, results, history, firm and angry science,<br>is how you get the raw facts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You should also look at success of self education,<br>and <span>try to understand what Duncan Campbell teachers us about the so called F students<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Sir Ken Robinson<sup>[9]</sup></span> says that schools are killing creativity,<br>and Campbell proves at least to me that the only failures are the teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a way we don’t even need proof,<br>it is the risk of ineffective education alone, that is all the argument we need to take to self education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What we know influences the decisions we make,<br>those in turn influence all the life ahead of us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is too risky to trust the teachers,<br>it is better to accept the responsibility for our own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which is why you need a laboratory,<br>with Learn Electronics Kits, Soldering Irons and Soldering Iron Accessories.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is why you need a 3D printer with an auto-bed-leveling kit, and few glass surfaces that you can swap out instead of waiting for the print to cool off,<br>and a mountain of PLA filament along with a little $10 baggie of extrudes so that you never run out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will need an office projector, connected to a laptop, so that you can play around with the brightness contrast slider while you are projecting on the canvas,<br>and you need frames that match your canvas for when you feel like exhibiting your art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A good computer for programming is also very important,<br>make sure you have a fancy keyboard, and master p5js as soon as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And, of course you have to master saying,<br>"<span>Deedee, get out of my laboratory!<sup>[10]</sup></span>"</div>
