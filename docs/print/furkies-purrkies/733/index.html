  <div class="paragraph">Our greatest inventions,<br>have been nothing short of our most beautiful poetry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And so I dreamed up a museum,<br>and entered to see most magnificent works of art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each one was priced at,<br>3.5 million dollars which is very little.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As these were works of art,<br>that have not yet been created.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even so it is more than enough,<br>that when bought...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The artist will receive,<br>100 dollars per day for life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually creating a work of art or science,<br>worth much more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Living a life unconstrained by the madness of poverty,<br>by the leash that holds us all back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The art from places where poverty was hardest,<br>was bought out first.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The elder people who did most of the buying,<br>knew that they were purchasing poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the students never saw the bad,<br>they didn't see much good...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They just couldn't imagine,<br>why a child should be cursed by poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why hold a mind back,<br>why hold the advancement of human kind hostage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The sunflowers flourished,<br>and a cultural change arose as a direct result...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of purchasing art,<br>from the museum of the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The students saw how strange we were,<br>how always on the brink of war.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How poverty,<br>wouldn't let us be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The buyers knew the future couldn't be betrayed,<br>by the children who grew up unafraid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they build, of my dear they built,<br>without a hint of greed or guilt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they took an extra day,<br>waiting until Sunday...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To activate not a blank-bank but a Museum Of Art,<br>with a red symbol of a heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where each and every student; on the first day school,<br>filed for a card as a rule.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One hundred dollars a day,<br>to keep poverty away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can comprehend, if you can hold a pencil in your hand,<br>then your poverty is at its end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cross whatever borders call to you,<br>and study and learn, and expand your view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we never go back to the dark ages again,<br>may our dealings be more humane.</div>
