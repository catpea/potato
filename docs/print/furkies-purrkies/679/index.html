  <div class="paragraph">Music is not something you learn,<br>it is something you unleash.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Forget music theory,<br>invent your own thory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lmms will get you started,<br>take the <span>lmms tutorial<sup>[1]</sup></span>, and hit the can!</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I consider cans to be bell like instruments, or cymbals,<br>and I think it is a good idea to leave higher pitches sounds for last.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you start with plastic bottles,<br>you get a sound that fills the background of you song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is just more echo,<br>and the sound is more profound and loooonger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't use forks,<br>so I brought one of my metal chopsticks with me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will start by playing my water bottle,<br>it is a thick, rectangular two liter face twisting watermelon juice, juice bottle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I won't start with just one strike of the bottle,<br>I like my drums complex.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But more than that,<br>I like to hit my drums in such a way that it creates a double whammy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A transition between two sounds,<br>at first you will hear the two hits separately then I'll mix them up a bit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Upon the resolution of the intro, I will very gently introduce a third drum,<br>also based on my water bottle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But that is just to give an occasional deeper hit,<br>as if an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tempo will be set to 280 beats per minute,<br>and I will slowly turn up the re-verb, bass boost and the equalizer as we go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(intro plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have purchased a little red mixing bowl for my salads recently,<br>and grabbed it last time I was downstairs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We will use it is to deepen the drum,<br>creating an evolving exclamation mark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also hit my water bottle too hard on the edge,<br>and rather than it marking a sound, it was metal chopstick that stole the show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So I'll mix in a gentle metallic sound,<br>as if to throw in a bit of Jalapeno into our salad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It just happens that the metallic sounds helps us move,<br>so the introduction jumps right into fast dance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Grab onto something,<br>and give this a listen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(dance plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, no drum kit is complete,<br>without a bucket and fruit can.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though un-intimidating raw,<br>with a touch of bass, a bucket is as mighty as it sounds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(middle plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I recently 3D printed a wallet prototype dodad,<br>and it turns out to be very drum like when struck with my chopsticks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So as the song winds down,<br>and introduce it to add a little bid of wood like drum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is the song in full,<br>I hope you enjoy it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After the song, I have included,<br>the raw unfiltered version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may not be very fun to listen to,<br>but it is interesting to hear the raw instruments.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(<span>full song<sup>[2]</sup></span> plays)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now,<br>for the unprocessed version.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(<span>raw song<sup>[3]</sup></span> plays)</div>
