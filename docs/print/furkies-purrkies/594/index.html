  <div class="paragraph">There are so many things to learn,<br>that once we get distracted we never return.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that is absolutely the right way,<br>self education is totally about play.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means that we just keep learning new things,<br>that we fly with our wonderful wings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there are countless places to visit too,<br>and as soon as you visit, you think of somewhere new.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is one of the things that wisdom demands,<br>it is how our minds expands.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We don't have to become experts at recording sound,<br>to make a chipper song that is pretty good all around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Likewise, we don't need an expensive tutor,<br>to program a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just a few videos will do,<br>and they will certainly expand our view.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest thing is to go slow,<br>follow your curiosity and let it flow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It does not matter how fast you go,<br>there are just too many things to know.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">So stop often and enjoy your learning quests,<br>learning for real does not require stupid tests.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take to adventure, computers, or art,<br>and don't worry about being smart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Smart is a silly myth that teachers tell,<br>it is a rare teacher that does their job very well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all extremely smart,<br>but we have to aim for wisdom listen to our heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You cannot be forced to learn,<br>you can only learn that, for which you yearn.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that,<br>you have to frequently switch you hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dance around and mix your bookmarks and books up,<br>search for new talents that you can pickup.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can start sculpting with clay,<br>and then jump into 3D modeling next day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools can't teach you like that,<br>they won't let you wear another hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is important that you slowly learn on your own,<br>so that later you are not sad about things you wish you have known.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think the most important thing about knowing a lot,<br>is that we get used to building bridges, a lot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ability to create photo realistic drawings,<br>for example, is about creating a system of things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not about knowing how to do it by hand,<br>initially everything is carefully pre-planned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Later we find we memorize a lot of it somehow,<br>but it is better to teach rather than pretend to wow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is best to share,<br>to show the world that we really do care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the end of the day there are just too many things to know,<br>it is not about learning perfectly, but that we grow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perfection is a very silly idea too,<br>because you... are you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are already extremely smart,<br>and perfectly capable of creating unique art.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your creations <strong>can</strong> build on other peoples work,<br>but they are supposed to be your own quirk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Build bridges, create a new kind of rhyme,<br>all you have to do is build upwards one layer at a time.</div>
