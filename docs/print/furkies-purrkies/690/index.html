      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Exceptional Abilities: You Learn Most When You Do The Things You Like</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People know schools are fake,<br>real companies will look for <span>Evidence Of Exceptional Ability<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will not gain any Exceptional Abilities,<br>in High School or College.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it is crazy to view college as proof,<br>that someone can soldier through their chores.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If they are brainless chores,<br>that demand inauthentic learning, then the person becomes worse for participating in it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you have to prove your exceptional abilities to a company,<br>you are doing something wrong.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A career is a dangerous idea,<br>it is better to use your exceptional abilities to become an <span>Independent Entrepreneur<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no way to describe what you can do,<br>once you gain multiple exceptional abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your combination of superpowers will be different from everybody else,<br>and you will not be interested in following a path, even a less grassy one.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything is about you is unique,<br>we have so many qualities across time, that they just can't repeat to make two people, the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are universally unique,<br>you will happen once.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teachers will lie to you that you can't use a calculator in real life,<br>that you can't get a job without a diploma, and that you can't have a career unless you jump through all the hoops.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will be forced to abandon the things that are interesting to you,<br>and processed via High School, to give money to College.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Upon graduation from College,<br>you will not have any abilities, and you will be in massive debt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you can get hired because you have a Diploma,<br>you will be forced to work more and more, while your salary stays the same.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will be surrounded by lairs,<br>in a desperate situation like that, they probably do get ahead, but they are also untrustworthy and lack a real integrated personality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In short, this whole thing,<br>cheats you out of learning what you like and Gaining Exceptional abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then puts you in debt,<br>and continues using you; until you just can't work anymore - until you just can't do it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a conspiracy,<br>it seems when people are mislead into a fake education, they behave in a certain way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just the moment the free school runs out,<br><span>colleges will line up to take the maximum possible amount of not just the money you have, but also the maximum amount of money you can borrow<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To pay off the debt,<br>companies evolved to ask for multiple years of experience in entry level positions, to belittle you, in order to force you to accept low offers - the only offers they ever offer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is if they are actually trying to hire you,<br>bringing in family members to a big company requires a number of interviews, to prevent fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, a lot of interviews are fake, to make it seem like many candidates are being interviewed,<br>but you won't even get the job if you answer all the questions 100% correct, because some is just trying to get their brother in law in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can spot the fake interviews sometimes when you are good at the job,<br>you answer all the questions, and the fake interview lady will ask you "how do you know all this?" - whoopsie!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well to answer her question,<br>Exceptional Abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you definitely don't want that job,<br>no matter how prestigious it is, a corrupt workplace will quickly make yo ill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">You have to travel the path of your curiosities,<br>3D Printers, Programming (or Programming Screen Savers, or Programming Drones for Racing, or Programming Generative Sculptures), Art - be it Sculpture, Canvas or Digital - or even Hiking the Appalachian Trail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you are learning something that you like and arrive at Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry,<br>you will also enjoy learning it too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In High School or College, not only are you forced to Math alone without any context that you could enjoy,<br>but you are also forced to memorize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't memorize you will not pass the class,<br>because if you tried to learn the medley of topics for real it would take Months, often Years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lectures are designed in such a way as to pressure you into memorization,<br>because testing memorized items is easy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Testing real knowledge is very difficult,<br>it may not be possible to asses the Exceptional Abilities of a person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often the pursuit of a single curiosity will enhance dozens of their talents,<br>they will have upwards of 300 exceptional abilities - and they will not even be able to name 10 of those.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real is such personal process it can't be standardized,<br>the interview would have to take months.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even then it would be pointless,<br>as within those months you would have expanded and enhanced your abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are learners, exceptional abilities is what we do,<br>unless we get tricked by school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If school is blocking you from learning for real,<br>and then forcing you into college and college debt with lies, and careers full of liars.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Than that is not good,<br>you will never find proof in time to see that you are being taken advantage of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to ask questions, to your Teachers, Guidance Counselors, Principals, and all the others,<br>they won't expect you because they know you don't have enough experience in life to spot the fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way you get at that experience is Narrated Book - it can't get easier,<br>read between the lines of Biographies, Adventure Books, Travel Memoirs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Usually the prestigious award winning books,<br>have the most to say about life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to books,<br>don't follow, don't merely believe, read the same books that great beings do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't let anybody or anything trick you out of learning for real,<br>take good care of your talents, take good care of your Exceptional Abilities.</div>
