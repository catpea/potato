      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Super Tiny Poem About Building Your First Visual Programming Company</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a couple of interesting <span>visual programming libraries<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br>of which <span>rete<sup>[2]</sup></span> looks rather fetching, not to mention the <span>7.6k stars on github<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Visual programming can be amazing, if done correctly, and if it is user friendly,<br>and respectful towards programmers that just want to do their own thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a difficult poem to write, it is not possible to explain anything in here,<br>as it would go on forever, I will just touch upon the most important parts and get to the end.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The program must focus on creating JSON or data based output,<br>when a user clicks save, they will just save a description of their program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there is an export button, and here the user can install different exporters,<br>the main exporter would be a monolithic node-modules repository.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that the data description of the program,<br>is sent through a code generator that generates very beautiful and easy to red code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The programmers who don't use visual programming,<br>would be pleasantly surprised at the code quality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And not really be able to tell that the code was generated<br>via a VPL, or a visual programming language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">See the <span>yeoman<sup>[4]</sup></span> project for an example of converting few input parameters,<br>into working node_modules or projects.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Some code generators will export for local execution, others may aim for electron GUI,<br>others still for task queue based processing, and finally auto-provisioning server networks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Auto provisioning means, system detects a spike in usage or network congestion,<br>and pays someone hourly or per second to offload the processing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means that the network grows as needed, and when there is little usage,<br>one beefy server can probably handle it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Users must be able to create their own visual programming nodes,<br>as a side effect, people learning programming would fell comfortable in large programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who are opinionated about a certain way of programming will feel right at home,<br>be it the wild wild west event based programming or tidy and strict flow based madness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally (I told you this was going to be short),<br>users who create new nodes, or groups of nodes that combine to create reusable code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Must be able to publish their work in a marketplace,<br>it is only fair to make the marketplace free so that everyone can make their own store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most uses will go with the central company,<br>as it is most responsible when it comes to code quality, review, and payment processing.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you were to build such a program, you may need to invite your classmates,<br>you will need co founders and friends who will work for potential payout.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is a small company idea that needs a lot of advertising,<br>if you have the patience for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you certainly have a product to sell,<br>you can invite programmers to sell their nodes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or you can contact large companies in need of custom software,<br>and show them what that program would look like visuially.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And show them with great precision all the custom nodes they would need to pay for,<br>to get it off the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lastly, and I think this is my favorite idea,<br>you could build the visual programming language to learn how to program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And follow up with a small company,<br>to <span>learn how to build and launch stat-ups<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
