<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But before you get started,<br>know that the world of art is completely uncharted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only rules that people make,<br>are for their own sake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People that lie about being smart,<br>will try to push you away from art.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When you enter the art scene,<br>bring an image projector and use your canvas as a screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Project an image that you like,<br>and make your version more dreamlike.</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember to use a canvas that you can move,<br>and start with something cheap to get into the groove.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A light 4x8ft sanded <span>plywood panel<sup>[1]</sup></span> can go a long way,<br>you can paint it and repaint it all day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once a gallery wishes to display your works,<br>you may get it framed for free - one of the perks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So don't paint near the edge, as it will get scratched,<br>and maybe sometimes cracked or detached.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But do treat your panels and canvas with a primer,<br>in no time you'll be painting like an old timer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you wish to clear your canvas and take a new route,<br>sand down the paint that sticks out.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This is your kingdom of art,<br>and you have to pick where to start.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Art is both a way to live,<br>and a way with which you can give.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a projector proportions will always come out great,<br>in no time you will be ready to paint.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mixing colors is an another kind of art,<br>take small steps and use your heart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And finally, when you creation,<br>speaks with contrast and saturation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must rise above your source image or trace,<br>you should even go past the smile on a face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You manually apply photo filters that only a wise artist can,<br>that should always be the final step in your plan.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">A photo does not make a perfect portrait, at all,<br>unless you are taking a picture of a wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A photo only captures the proportions and shadows,<br>to do a person justice, only an artist can come close.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because a machine cannot know,<br>when eyes shine or the face has a glow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A photo only takes a short peek,<br>but people are as complex as unique.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The full and true reason why we need art,<br>is because a photos cannot really capture the best part.</div>
