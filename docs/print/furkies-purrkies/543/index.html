    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is only one kind of education,<br>and that is Integrated Education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that means,<br>that everything you learn is strongly connected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are no grades here, you get paid for achievement,<br>and you graduate the moment you build your first successful company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way you learn Math for example,<br>is by starting out with computer programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of programming all the math is done for you,<br>until you are ready to create something generated by a computer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This could be a series of generative artworks,<br>or even generative products that can be sold online.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, you will either get stuck,<br>or become seriously interested in real math, to accomplish something - that you need.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what will come next is not learning math,<br>but it's complete self driven mastery, because you will need it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From here you may take to CNC milling machines, 3D printers,<br>water or laser cutters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An integrated education, is a single road,<br>and each new stretch of the road emerges from the entire distance that you have traveled thus far.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is an education that is important to you,<br>that is absolutely your own achievement.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You learn at your own pace,<br>and you learn in a sequence that you set.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A sequence that fits your existing knowledge,<br>and where you stand, and is respectful of where you are headed next.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">You will not be graded,<br>you will not have a grade point average.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there will be investors interested in good ideas,<br>and minds that are deeply passionate about them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Investors are people that give you free money,<br>thousands of dollars with a promise of more, if you show good ideas and good progress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the end, they may own 10% of your company,<br>and certainly will be interested in its success, as much as you are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will only make money when you make money,<br>they are there to help you, so that they can help themselves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most of them will be graduates of the schools you joined,<br>they are there to mentor you, they are there to help you grow.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">This second part of this text tries to explain.<br>how and why you are being tricked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you should consider this part as being mostly wrong,<br>and use your own best judgment to figure out what is actually going on in your own school.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all stop pretending that you are getting a real education,<br>all those disconnected facts never do come together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers are poor,<br>and they need to keep their job with as little effort as possible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can't do anything but follow the rules,<br>and the higher you go the more abstract everything becomes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your school and all the people involved in your education, are there to get paid,<br>they can't afford to care about real and integrated education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are just following rules,<br>they are just acting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are not fully aware that they are selling you out for a small paycheck,<br>but if they were, they would try not to think about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If any of your teachers tried to teach you for real,<br>you would not pass the state requirements.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The school would lose accreditation and or funding,<br>it would cease to exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need to trick you into thinking that it will all come together,<br>to put food on their table.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will not come together,<br>everything you are learning will remain disconnected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The kids that do get the subjects,<br>are getting support, tutors, correct explanations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And are genuinely curious,<br>about the subject that they are good at.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers in the other classes,<br>are giving them higher grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers will not give a 4.0 student a bad grade,<br>the student would return to repeat the class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But mostly it would make the teacher look bad,<br>nobody wants to ruin a 4.0.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those students are not smarter than you,<br>it is that the school need them to have that 4.0.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some students,<br>force themselves in to memorization, and some small measure of comprehensions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But their high grades,<br>as hard as it was to get them, are not real.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They do not represent the understanding of Chemistry, Physics, and Biology,<br>just how to reliably pass the classes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They have been tricked,<br>just like you have been tricked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the motive behind this fraud,<br>is everyone getting paid, the lunch lady, the cleaning staff, the teachers, and everyone else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is this old apocryphal story, where a bank robber was asked why he robs banks,<br>his answer: because that is where the money is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without a real education, you will not be able to get a good job,<br>or you will be pushed into lying and pretending, just like the teachers are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a self replicating cycle,<br>it goes unnoticed because very few people get a taste of real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes people who are getting are real education,<br>will be told it is not a real education because it is not a balanced education - so be careful - <span>pay attention to results<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The 4.0 GPA students don't want anybody to know their grades are inauthentic,<br>because they want to keep getting straight A's with as much ease as possible...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To get the hell out of there,<br>and they don't mind the inauthentic praise either.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to learn how to create your own products,<br>how to get investors, and how to successfully run the business.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One big reason why the teachers aren't teaching you for real,<br>is because real education is a lot harder than a fake education - and it may not even be possible in an organized education setting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Aside from selling you out,<br>they want to sell you out in a manner, that is as easy as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if they owned up to it,<br>there is nothing they can do to help all the students in your school with real education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Aside from everyone soon loosing their job, there would be too many questions,<br>that they are mostly too unqualified for to answer,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which brings us to the closing part of this text,<br>you have to become a real teacher.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What you learn,<br>is what you are going to teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must begin keeping notes,<br>for those that will be seeking help on the same subject.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of your first companies will be a small somewhat automated school,<br>and it will double as an investor hub.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The investors will give you money,<br>for connecting them with the graduates.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education will end,<br>just as soon as people will begin noticing real results from real schools.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parents who were once prepared to put some money towards college,<br>will much rather spend that money on classes that provide real results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, I will leave you with an example of such a little school,<br>lets us assume that you are curious about 3D printing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though this applies to any stepping stone like dance, music, photo realistic drawing,<br>any stepping stone that helps people out of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So you begin learning FreeCAD, and Blender,<br>and get an Ender printer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As you learn you create a curriculum, with lovely milestones,<br>for others to follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While being mindful, that they will require a powerful and authentic entry in their portfolio;<br>perhaps one that includes videos, sketches, and maybe a real newspaper article about graduating from your class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then you take in some number of students,<br>and begin teaching them how to get to a point where they are able to print things that are useful to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You get them to buy an Ender,<br>you help them assemble and fine tune it, and teach them how to set up and use all the software.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will want to get to the end,<br>they will want to print things, build things.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can expand your school,<br>to teach related subjects - and your students and graduates will help to advertise it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike the fake schools,<br>your graduates with walk out with the ability to create real products.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From a more general perspective,<br>people will be learning what they need,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will be progressing on their own path of real self education,<br>one that brings results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please,<br>please...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stop pretending that you are actually learning in school, stop memorizing disconnected facts,<br>start learning for your self, in a sequence that makes sense to you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Help the other students understand,<br>set them free to a bright future they can understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And help the lost kids in the back understand that the school they know now put them there because it is all just a show to sell them out,<br>tell them that they too were geniuses all along, and that their genius and creativity will know no bounds once they take to self education.</div>
