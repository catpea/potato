    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let me be very clear about this,<br>while it is not a conspiracy, you didn't choose cramming, you were manipulated into it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let me show you what you are up against, and how impossible it seems,<br>the notion of pre-requisite classes is mostly about getting you to brainlessly memorize.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">No one sat down to invent it this way,<br>it is just that over time teachers settled into it, because it worked out well for them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The way you see the truth in this, is by asking yourself,<br>what the heck is a school anyway - you have to back all the way out...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And ask if the invention of school should have a mechanism,<br>that will force students into memorization, cramming, and pretending to learn.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do we we want to cut students off,<br>deny them access to knowledge, to lectures, because they don't know something.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do people learn in an order dictated by standards,<br>and should they fail if they take too long.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Should we put them in rows,<br>and cut lectures off at a precise time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You see, the entire organization of school,<br>serves the teachers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And they serve you,<br>with easy to memorize disconnected facts.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pre-requisites, or classes that ASSUME, you memorized other classes,<br>are just pluming that pass you along for a paycheck.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And don't ask how classes could possibly work,<br>if there was a mix of people with different levels of knowledge.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">People always have different knowledge,<br>we all have unique talents and curiosities.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You see, it isn't just pre-requisites,<br>but the damn classrooms, and the timed lecture, and sitting in rows that is all a theater.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are forcing you to memorize,<br>what will be on state tests - so that they can keep accreditation, and keep getting paid.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The common art teacher, with watercolors in hand,<br>does not ask questions, they just do their job.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that would be fine, if their actions didn't impact anybody else,<br>they wouldn't be hurting anybody.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not asking questions is the way fraud happens,<br>talk about teaching critical thinking.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They have threatened you with bad grades, bad GPA,<br>being held back and permanently marked as delayed, and threatened your career.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And they are giving you material so bad, under the worst possible circumstances,<br>in order to process you like a sausage, for a paycheck.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Memorization is a guaranteed way,<br>to keep accreditation.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In some cases, they medicate students who are fine,<br>just don't want to fill their heads with noise.</div>
