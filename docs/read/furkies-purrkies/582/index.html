    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It could be influence of alcohol or worse,<br>but also it can be the influence of being court marshaled or even yelled at by someone in control of their existence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I immediately realized that criminals are indoctrinated into crime,<br>this religion of crime, is not exactly emergent, it does not exactly come out of nowhere.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It comes out of poverty, from having parents who drink or do drugs because they can't make their way out of their poverty,<br>and then the threat of the neighborhood bullies, which often, as far as survival goes, means both gangs and the police.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All those scary individuals that most people agree to keep in cages,<br>are actually just children who had their minds poisoned.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I wouldn't say that it is a permanent poisoning,<br>I feel that psychologists know this.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And they also know that by keeping people in cages,<br>we make them worse.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I know, that we make ourselves worse for it,<br>a criminal belongs in a Medical Institution specifically built to undo the damage caused by indoctrination.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Prisons poison the minds of criminals further,<br>what they need is understanding, support, hope, future, - you know real justice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">More than that, once they are placed into institutions that aren't sick torture,<br>they may not wish to return to be among the people that did this to them.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Crime is a particularly potent example of the power of indoctrination,<br>which frequently can be explained as "Acting against themselves".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But indoctrination is everywhere,<br>meaning that people are doing things that they think are meaningful, but actually they are just hurting themselves or the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Take the other end of the crime spectrum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrfZuPFrH8A">a cop planting evidence on a known criminal</a> that should be in jail,<br>the cop was brought up in a culture of putting criminals in cages, the criminal was brought up in a culture of crime.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are both wrong, they are both just little spinning tops wound up by their indoctrination,<br>in very desperate need of psychological help, but round and round they go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In a more advanced civilization, all the parties involved here and their families would be relocated,<br>given a bright new start at life, and over and over again, until they became free of their psychological indoctrination.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their new lives would include expensive housing, free money from an Advanced Universal Income program,<br>and room to take to education, and eventually helping others out of their indoctrination.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See a primitive civilization punishes,<br>an advanced civilization looks to prevention and therapy - we have a lot of work to do.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Punishing the police officer would only destabilize them further,<br>and punishing those boys, who already have a stressful and desperate life, suffering addiction, debt, poverty, violence, will certainly make things worse.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no solution at the level our civilization is currently operating at,<br>the poor boys are suffering the same condition that otherwise reasonable men from Afghanistan who-dont-want-women-in-school are suffering from.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their reality is warped, but they are fighting, tooth and nail, like the Great Warriors we all are,<br>except that the warping of their reality is making them hurt themselves.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Often self harm becomes apparent, far too late, when one of those boys becomes a father,<br>and watches their son become like they are...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Except now the father gained a grasp on the invisible prison of cultural and psychological indoctrination he was born into,<br>and is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk--XN4ozr8">crying that he does not want his son to be like him</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See, once indoctrination is removed, bullies and thugs,<br>will slowly being self repair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their past life does not stand, in their way towards greatness,<br>we stand in their way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By sentencing a person stricken by indoctrination into years in prison,<br>we only make things worse, we hurt them further.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I believe it was The Great Michelle Alexander that described a Judge crying,<br>for tearing a family apart, because the father did not break out of his indoctrination fast enough, and ended up being sentenced to prison.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We must ask, how can we help these men out of their indoctrination sooner,<br>and eventually we will find that indoctrination is best prevented.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One of the major components of Prevention,<br>is ending poverty, granting the entire family Access to Free Money, and Advanced Universal Income.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">No sum in particular,<br>just a respectful and very generous daily spending limit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This will go a long way, but the process of un-indoctrination,<br>is brittle, requires decades of therapy and re-education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While prevention comes with a clear guarantee,<br>a person already hurt by long therm indoctrination, requires special treatment, preferential treatment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is our misuse of the idea of money, and tolerance of the sick punishment of prisons,<br>that fractures people, that induces the emergence of broken cultures, and repeatedly indoctrinates participants.</div>
